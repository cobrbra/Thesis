We introduce a flexible framework for transfer learning in the context of binary classification, allowing for covariate-dependent relationships between the source and target distributions that are not required to preserve the Bayes decision boundary. Our main contributions are to derive the minimax optimal rates of convergence (up to poly-logarithmic factors) in this problem, and show that the optimal rate can be achieved by an algorithm that adapts to key aspects of the unknown transfer relationship, as well as the smoothness and tail parameters of our distributional classes. This optimal rate turns out to have several regimes, depending on the interplay between the relative sample sizes and the strength of the transfer relationship, and our algorithm achieves optimality by careful, decision tree-based calibration of local nearest-neighbour procedures.},

Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property, whereby even if our pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same regret bounds as an oracle who has a-priori knowledge of these nuisance components.

It is demonstrated how the role of each assumption is intimately related to the sort of causal inference being considered. Contrary to general belief, it is shown that neither `no confounding' nor `randomization' are sufficient assumptions for testing the fundamental causal hypothesis of `no causation'. They become sufficient, however, if supplemented by a `modelling' assumption for how unobserved covariates affect potential responses. Without supplementary assumptions, no confounding and randomization allow testing of weaker but more important hypotheses, such as `no mean effect'. This follows from the sufficiency of an assumption of `ignorable treatment assignment' for testing the hypothesis of `no distribution effect'. It is argued that these ideas will have some operational relevance if we can quantify our beliefs about how closely assumptions hold. To illustrate, a novel form of sensitivity analysis is contrasted with an analysis presented by Rosenbaum and Rubin.},

Abstract
Lung cancer is one of the most common human malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Novel therapeutic approaches, like targeted therapies against specific molecular alterations and immunotherapy, have revolutionized in the last decade the oncological outcomes in patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The advent of immunotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC has significantly improved overall and progression-free survival, as well as the patient’s quality of life in comparison to traditional chemotherapy. Currently, it is estimated that long-term survival can be achieved in more than 15\% of NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy. Therefore, the optimal duration of immunotherapy in long survivors needs to be established to avoid overtreatment, side effects, and high costs and at the same time, protect them from potential disease relapse or progression. We performed a narrative review to discuss all the aspects related to the optimal duration of immunotherapy in long survivors with NSCLC. Data regarding the duration of immunotherapy in the most impacting clinical trials were collected, along with data regarding the impact of toxicities, side effects, and costs for healthcare providers. In addition, the two-year immunotherapy scheme in patients who benefit from first-line or subsequent treatment lines are examined, and the need for biomarkers that can predict outcomes during and after immunotherapy cessation in patients affected by NSCLC are discussed.},

Unlike most time-to-event models, we focus on the estimation of time-to-event distributions, rather than time ordering.

	abstract = {Given two probability measures, \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\$ defined on a measurable space, \$S\$, the integral probability metric (IPM) is defined as \$\${\textbackslash}gamma\_\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\}({\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\},{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\})={\textbackslash}sup{\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}vert {\textbackslash}int\_\{S\}f{\textbackslash},d{\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}-{\textbackslash}int\_\{S\}f{\textbackslash},d{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}{\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}vert{\textbackslash},:{\textbackslash},f{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}{\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}\},\$\$ where \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$ is a class of real-valued bounded measurable functions on \$S\$. By appropriately choosing \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$, various popular distances between \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\$, including the Kantorovich metric, Fortet-Mourier metric, dual-bounded Lipschitz distance (also called the Dudley metric), total variation distance, and kernel distance, can be obtained. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating \${\textbackslash}gamma\_\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\}\$ from finite random samples drawn i.i.d. from \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\$. Although the above mentioned distances cannot be computed in closed form for every \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}\$, we show their empirical estimators to be easily computable, and strongly consistent (except for the total-variation distance). We further analyze their rates of convergence. Based on these results, we discuss the advantages of certain choices of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$ (and therefore the corresponding IPMs) over others—in particular, the kernel distance is shown to have three favorable properties compared with the other mentioned distances: it is computationally cheaper, the empirical estimate converges at a faster rate to the population value, and the rate of convergence is independent of the dimension \$d\$ of the space (for \$S={\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{d\}\$). We also provide a novel interpretation of IPMs and their empirical estimators by relating them to the problem of binary classification: while the IPM between class-conditional distributions is the negative of the optimal risk associated with a binary classifier, the smoothness of an appropriate binary classifier (e.g., support vector machine, Lipschitz classifier, etc.) is inversely related to the empirical estimator of the IPM between these class-conditional distributions.},

Many recently proposed strategies assume ignorability of the treatment assignment mechanism and require fitting two models—one for the assignment mechanism and one for the response surface. This article proposes a strategy that instead focuses on very flexibly modeling just the response surface using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling procedure, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). BART has several advantages: it is far simpler to use than many recent competitors, requires less guesswork in model fitting, handles a large number of predictors, yields coherent uncertainty intervals, and fluidly handles continuous treatment variables and missing data for the outcome variable. BART also naturally identifies heterogeneous treatment effects. BART produces more accurate estimates of average treatment effects compared to propensity score matching, propensity-weighted estimators, and regression adjustment in the nonlinear simulation situations examined. Further, it is highly competitive in linear settings with the “correct” model, linear regression. Supplemental materials including code and data to replicate simulations and examples from the article as well as methods for population inference are available online.},

For example, the field of microbiology was transformed with the advent of Anton van Leeuwenhoek's microscope, which allowed scientists to visualize prokaryotes for the first time. The development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of those innovations that changed the course of molecular science with its impact spanning countless subdisciplines in biology. The theoretical process was outlined by Keppe and coworkers in 1971; however, it was another 14 years until the complete PCR procedure was described and experimentally applied by Kary Mullis while at Cetus Corporation in 1985. Automation and refinement of this technique progressed with the introduction of a thermal stable DNA polymerase from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus, consequently the name Taq DNA polymerase., PCR is a powerful amplification technique that can generate an ample supply of a specific segment of DNA (i.e., an amplicon) from only a small amount of starting material (i.e., DNA template or target sequence). While straightforward and generally trouble-free, there are pitfalls that complicate the reaction producing spurious results. When PCR fails it can lead to many non-specific DNA products of varying sizes that appear as a ladder or smear of bands on agarose gels. Sometimes no products form at all. Another potential problem occurs when mutations are unintentionally introduced in the amplicons, resulting in a heterogeneous population of PCR products. PCR failures can become frustrating unless patience and careful troubleshooting are employed to sort out and solve the problem(s). This protocol outlines the basic principles of PCR, provides a methodology that will result in amplification of most target sequences, and presents strategies for optimizing a reaction. By following this PCR guide, students should be able to: ● Set up reactions and thermal cycling conditions for a conventional PCR experiment ● Understand the function of various reaction components and their overall effect on a PCR experiment ● Design and optimize a PCR experiment for any DNA template ● Troubleshoot failed PCR experiments},

	abstract = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400–800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from {\textgreater}30× average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

	abstract = {The tumor microenvironment is created by the tumor and dominated by tumor-induced interactions. Although various immune effector cells are recruited to the tumor site, their anti-tumor functions are downregulated, largely in response to tumor-derived signals. Infiltrates of inflammatory cells present in human tumors are chronic in nature and are enriched in regulatory T cells (Treg) as well as myeloid suppressor cells (MSC). Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment not only fail to exercise anti-tumor effector functions, but they are co-opted to promote tumor growth. Sustained activation of the NF-κB pathway in the tumor milieu represents one mechanism that appears to favor tumor survival and drive abortive activation of immune cells. The result is tumor escape from the host immune system. Tumor escape is accomplished through the activation of one or several molecular mechanisms that lead to inhibition of immune cell functions or to apoptosis of anti-tumor effector cells. The ability to block tumor escape depends on a better understanding of cellular and molecular pathways operating in the tumor microenvironment. Novel therapeutic strategies that emerge are designed to change the pro-tumor microenvironment to one favoring acute responses and potent anti-tumor activity.},

Additionally genetic and genomic biomarkers may identify individuals with a constitutional basis for their disease that may not be evident clinically. Genomic biomarker testing may detect molecular variations in single genes, panels of genes, or entire genomes. The strength of evidence for the association of a genomic biomarker with disease risk may be weak or strong. The factors contributing to clinical validity and utility of genomic biomarkers include functional laboratory analyses and genetic epidemiologic evidence. Genomic biomarkers may be further classified as low, moderate or highly penetrant based on the likelihood of disease. Genomic biomarkers for breast cancer are comprised of rare highly penetrant mutations of genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, moderately penetrant mutations of genes such as CHEK2, as well as more common genomic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, associated with modest effect sizes. When applied in the context of appropriate counseling and interpretation, identification of genomic biomarkers of inherited risk for breast cancer may decrease morbidity and mortality, allow for definitive prevention through assisted reproduction, and serve as a guide to targeted therapy.},

	abstract = {Modern pharmaceuticals and medical devices have provided substantial benefits to patients throughout the world. These benefits come at a high and increasing cost, with development of the typical pharmaceutical requiring 12 years and hundreds of millions of dollars before gaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration marketing approval. Appropriate use of imaging biomarkers—defined as anatomic, physiologic, biochemical, or molecular parameters detectable with imaging methods used to establish the presence or severity of disease—offer the prospect of smaller, less expensive, and more efficient preclinical studies and clinical trials. Scientists, government regulators, and industry have all recognized the potential of biomarkers in imaging. Although real, this promise can only be realized with the rigorous application of science to their use. Success is most likely when (a) the presence of an imaging marker is closely linked with the presence of a target disease; (b) detection and/or measurement of the biomarker is accurate, reproducible, and feasible over time; and (c) measured changes are closely linked to success or failure of the therapeutic effect of the product being evaluated. By applying this paradigm to the array of imaging modalities, the radiology community is poised to become a major force in preclinical and clinical evaluations of new medical treatments.

PD-L1, quantified using immunohistochemistry assays, is currently the most widely validated, used and accepted biomarker to guide the selection of patients to receive anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. However, many challenges remain in the clinical use of these assays, including the necessity of using different companion diagnostic assays for specific agents, high levels of inter-assay variability in terms of both performance and cut-off points, and a lack of prospective comparisons of how PD-L1+ disease diagnosed using each assay relates to clinical outcomes. In this Review, we describe the current role of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays used to inform the selection of patients to receive anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, we discuss the various technical and clinical challenges associated with these assays, including regulatory issues, and we provide some perspective on how to optimize PD-L1 as a selection biomarker for the future treatment of patients with solid tumours.},

This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer–promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.},

Metabolite signatures that have close proximity to subject’s phenotypic informative dimension, are useful for predicting diagnosis and prognosis of diseases as well as monitoring treatments.

Small molecule metabolites-based metabolomics has become a specialized tool for metabolic biomarker and pathway analysis, for revealing possible mechanisms of human various diseases and deciphering therapeutic potentials. It could help identify functional biomarkers related to phenotypic variation and delineate biochemical pathways changes as early indicators of pathological dysfunction and damage prior to disease development. Recently, scientists have established a large number of metabolic profiles to reveal the underlying mechanisms and metabolic networks for therapeutic target exploration in biomedicine. This review summarized the metabolic analysis on the potential value of small-molecule candidate metabolites as biomarkers with clinical events, which may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis, drug screening and treatment.

While early results are promising, this is a rapidly evolving field with new knowledge emerging in both cancer biology and deep learning. In this review, we provide an overview of emerging deep learning techniques and how they are being applied to oncology. We focus on the deep learning applications for omics data types, including genomic, methylation and transcriptomic data, as well as histopathology-based genomic inference, and provide perspectives on how the different data types can be integrated to develop decision support tools. We provide specific examples of how deep learning may be applied in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment management. We also assess the current limitations and challenges for the application of deep learning in precision oncology, including the lack of phenotypically rich data and the need for more explainable deep learning models. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how current obstacles can be overcome to enable future clinical utilisation of deep learning.},

	abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has dramatically improved the flexibility and outcomes of cancer research and clinical trials, providing highly sensitive and accurate high-throughput platforms for large-scale genomic testing. In contrast to whole-genome (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted genomic sequencing (TS) focuses on a panel of genes or targets known to have strong associations with pathogenesis of disease and/or clinical relevance, offering greater sequencing depth with reduced costs and data burden. This allows targeted sequencing to identify low frequency variants in targeted regions with high confidence, thus suitable for profiling low-quality and fragmented clinical DNA samples. As a result, TS has been widely used in clinical research and trials for patient stratification and the development of targeted therapeutics. However, its transition to routine clinical use has been slow. Many technical and analytical obstacles still remain and need to be discussed and addressed before large-scale and cross-centre implementation. Gold-standard and state-of-the-art procedures and pipelines are urgently needed to accelerate this transition. In this review we first present how TS is conducted in cancer research, including various target enrichment platforms, the construction of target panels, and selected research and clinical studies utilising TS to profile clinical samples. We then present a generalised analytical workflow for TS data discussing important parameters and filters in detail, aiming to provide the best practices of TS usage and analyses.},

Following the literature on local maximum likelihood estimation, our method considers a weighted set of nearby training examples; however, instead of using classical kernel weighting functions that are prone to a strong curse of dimensionality, we use an adaptive weighting function derived from a forest designed to express heterogeneity in the specified quantity of interest. We propose a flexible, computationally efficient algorithm for growing generalized random forests, develop a large sample theory for our method showing that our estimates are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian and provide an estimator for their asymptotic variance that enables valid confidence intervals. We use our approach to develop new methods for three statistical tasks: nonparametric quantile regression, conditional average partial effect estimation and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation via instrumental variables.

In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has become a global health pandemic. COVID-19 severity ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe multiorgan disease. Although the inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the exact nature of dysregulation in signaling pathways has not yet been elucidated, underscoring the need for further molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Here, we characterize the host response directly at the point of viral entry through analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. Multiplexed high-resolution MS-based proteomic analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases and negative controls identified 7582 proteins and revealed significant upregulation of interferon-mediated antiviral signaling in addition to multiple other proteins that are not encoded by interferon-stimulated genes or well characterized during viral infections. Downregulation of several proteasomal subunits, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and components of protein synthesis machinery was significant upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted proteomics to measure abundance levels of MX1, ISG15, STAT1, RIG-I, and CXCL10 detected proteomic signatures of interferon-mediated antiviral signaling that differentiated COVID-19-positive from COVID-19-negative cases. Phosphoproteomic analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of several proteins with known antiviral properties as well as several proteins involved in ciliary function (CEP131 and CFAP57) that have not previously been implicated in the context of coronavirus infections. In addition, decreased phosphorylation levels of AKT and PKC, which have been shown to play varying roles in different viral infections, were observed in infected individuals relative to controls. These data provide novel insights that add depth to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway and establish a proteomic signature for this viral infection.,

	abstract = {Background
Infectious diseases play a significant role in the global burden of disease. The gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial infection, bacterial culture, can lead to diagnostic delays and inappropriate antibiotic use. The advent of high- throughput technologies has led to the discovery of host-based genomic biomarkers of infection, capable of differentiating bacterial from other causes of infection, but few have achieved validation for use in a clinical setting.

Methods
A systematic review was performed. PubMed/Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and Scopus databases were searched for relevant studies from inception up to 30/03/2022 with forward and backward citation searching of key references. Studies assessing the diagnostic performance of human host genomic biomarkers of bacterial infection were included. Study selection and assessment of quality were conducted by two independent reviewers. A meta-analysis was undertaken using a diagnostic random-effects model. The review was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021208462).

Findings
Seventy-two studies evaluating the performance of 116 biomarkers in 16,216 patients were included. Forty-six studies examined TB-specific biomarker performance and twenty-four studies assessed biomarker performance in a paediatric population. The results of pooled sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of genomic biomarkers of bacterial infection were 0.80 (95\% CI 0.78 to 0.82), 0.86 (95\% CI 0.84 to 0.88), 0.18 (95\% CI 0.16 to 0.21), 5.5 (95\% CI 4.9 to 6.3), 30.1 (95\% CI 24 to 37), respectively. Significant between-study heterogeneity (I2 77\%) was present.

Interpretation
Host derived genomic biomarkers show significant potential for clinical use as diagnostic tests of bacterial infection however, further validation and attention to test platform is warranted before clinical implementation can be achieved.

We then review the applications of genomics to the investigation of outbreaks, either through the design of genotyping assays or the direct sequencing of the causative strains.

	abstract = {Sepsis and antimicrobial stewardship programmes coexist in tension, as they can appear to have apparently opposing messages around antimicrobial prescribing. In the era of increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there is a need for greater alignment between sepsis and antimicrobial stewardship governance and management programmes. Antimicrobial therapy is an essential part of sepsis management with a focus on time-dependent recognition and resuscitation pathways.1 Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis, and delay to first-dose antimicrobial is associated with increasing mortality.1 To avoid potential unintended consequences from inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, including increased AMR and healthcare-associated infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection, antimicrobial stewardship strategies including de-escalation protocols and stopping antimicrobials in non-infective cases should be a fundamental component of sepsis quality improvement initiatives.2 Perceived tensions remain, however, between managing sepsis and effective antimicrobial stewardship, and these perceptions are likely to be heightened by media reporting of the issues.3 The purpose of this viewpoint is to discuss these tensions, and suggest that a change in mindset is required with an integrated understanding of sepsis and AMR as two sides of the same coin.

Media framing of sepsis and AMR has been identified as influencing public expectation of antimicrobial prescribing as well as health professionals’ perceptions of optimal prescribing strategies. Sepsis media reports tend to use well-recognised triggers that increase public interest. These include emotive personal narratives that commonly centre on young patients, and which identify immediate solutions that are within the power of individual health professionals and the public (eg, increased awareness/recognition). In contrast, AMR is framed as a vague threat affecting future patients and involving multiple actors, often under the ‘One Health’ umbrella.4 Individual responsibility is diffused by presenting AMR as a global responsibility, which shares conceptual features with a ‘problem of many hands’,5 6 and the types …},

The primary exposure was antibiotics given within 6 hours of emergency department registration. The primary outcome was adjusted in-hospital mortality. We used detailed physiologic data to quantify severity of illness within 1 hour of registration and logistic regression to estimate the odds of hospital mortality based on antibiotic timing and patient factors., Measurements and Main Results: The median time to antibiotic administration was 2.1 hours (interquartile range, 1.4–3.1 h). The adjusted odds ratio for hospital mortality based on each hour of delay in antibiotics after registration was 1.09 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–1.13) for each elapsed hour between registration and antibiotic administration. The increase in absolute mortality associated with an hour’s delay in antibiotic administration was 0.3\% (95\% CI, 0.01–0.6\%; P = 0.04) for sepsis, 0.4\% (95\% CI, 0.1–0.8\%; P = 0.02) for severe sepsis, and 1.8\% (95\% CI, 0.8–3.0\%; P = 0.001) for shock., Conclusions: In a large, contemporary, and multicenter sample of patients with sepsis in the emergency department, hourly delays in antibiotic administration were associated with increased odds of hospital mortality even among patients who received antibiotics within 6 hours. The odds increased within each sepsis severity strata, and the increased odds of mortality were greatest in septic shock.},

Our work confirms drugs with genetically supported targets were more likely to be successful in Phases II and III.

Prior to the 2012 conference, five working groups of experts and public members met over a 1-year period. The working groups addressed the following: long-term outcomes and management across the lifespan; PKU and pregnancy; diet control and management; pharmacologic interventions; and molecular testing, new technologies, and epidemiologic considerations. In a parallel and independent activity, an Evidence-based Practice Center supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted a systematic review of adjuvant treatments for PKU; its conclusions were presented at the conference. The conference included the findings of the working groups, panel discussions from industry and international perspectives, and presentations on topics such as emerging treatments for PKU, transitioning to adult care, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory perspective. Over 85 experts participated in the conference through information gathering and/or as presenters during the conference, and they reached several important conclusions. The most serious neurological impairments in PKU are preventable with current dietary treatment approaches. However, a variety of more subtle physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of even well-controlled PKU are now recognized. The best outcomes in maternal PKU occur when blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations are maintained between 120 and 360 μmol/L before and during pregnancy. The dietary management treatment goal for individuals with PKU is a blood Phe concentration between 120 and 360 μmol/L. The use of genotype information in the newborn period may yield valuable insights about the severity of the condition for infants diagnosed before maximal Phe levels are achieved. While emerging and established genotype-phenotype correlations may transform our understanding of PKU, establishing correlations with intellectual outcomes is more challenging. Regarding the use of sapropterin in PKU, there are significant gaps in predicting response to treatment; at least half of those with PKU will have either minimal or no response. A coordinated approach to PKU treatment improves long-term outcomes for those with PKU and facilitates the conduct of research to improve diagnosis and treatment. New drugs that are safe, efficacious, and impact a larger proportion of individuals with PKU are needed. However, it is imperative that treatment guidelines and the decision processes for determining access to treatments be tied to a solid evidence base with rigorous standards for robust and consistent data collection. The process that preceded the PKU State-of-the-Science Conference, the conference itself, and the identification of a research agenda have facilitated the development of clinical practice guidelines by professional organizations and serve as a model for other inborn errors of metabolism.},

These include (1) failure of young infants to produce a positive test until several weeks after birth, even though there is evidence that blood phenylalanine concentration increases rapidly in the first few days of life in this condition (Armstrong et al., Proceedings of the Third International Neurochemical Symposium, 1958, to be published) and (2) failure of older PKU cases to produce a positive ferric chloride test if blood phenylalanine levels are below approximately 20 mg. per cent. Obviously a simple method of detecting elevated phenylalanine blood levels should overcome these limitations.Recently, with the cooperation of Dr. William Welch, Director of the Laboratory at Newark State School, Newark, N.Y., we have had the opportunity to develop},

Here, we demonstrate that the polypeptide fragments can instead be detected and classified at the single-molecule limit using a nanometer-scale pore formed by the protein aerolysin. Specifically, three different water-soluble proteins treated with the same protease, trypsin, produce different polypeptide fragments defined by the degree by which the latter reduce the nanopore’s ionic current.

	abstract = {We prove that the binary classifiers of bit strings generated by random wide deep neural networks with ReLU activation function are biased towards simple functions. The simplicity is captured by the following two properties. For any given input bit string, the average Hamming distance of the closest input bit string with a different classification is at least sqrt(n / (2\{{\textbackslash}pi\} log n)), where n is the length of the string. Moreover, if the bits of the initial string are flipped randomly, the average number of flips required to change the classification grows linearly with n. These results are confirmed by numerical experiments on deep neural networks with two hidden layers, and settle the conjecture stating that random deep neural networks are biased towards simple functions. This conjecture was proposed and numerically explored in [Valle P{\textbackslash}'erez et al., ICLR 2019] to explain the unreasonably good generalization properties of deep learning algorithms. The probability distribution of the functions generated by random deep neural networks is a good choice for the prior probability distribution in the PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. Our results constitute a fundamental step forward in the characterization of this distribution, therefore contributing to the understanding of the generalization properties of deep learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize remarkably well without explicit regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime where classical learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit. While many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit. In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional networks applied to CIFAR10 and MNIST. As the target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems. This picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output function space, rather than the more conventional prior over parameter space. If we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets. By exploiting recently discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the marginal likelihood, we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully connected networks.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

A vector representation is associated to each character \$n\$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks.

While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models.},

Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet).

	abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 39.7{\textbackslash}\% and 18.9{\textbackslash}\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art results. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and two globally connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of convolutional nets. To reduce overfitting in the globally connected layers we employed a new regularization method that proved to be very effective.},

Advantages over existing platforms include direct measurement of mRNA expression levels without enzymatic reactions or bias, sensitivity coupled with high multiplex capability, and digital readout. Experiments performed on 509 human genes yielded a replicate correlation coefficient of 0.999, a detection limit between 0.1 fM and 0.5 fM, and a linear dynamic range of over 500-fold. Comparison of the NanoString nCounter gene expression system with microarrays and TaqMan PCR demonstrated that the nCounter system is more sensitive than microarrays and similar in sensitivity to real-time PCR. Finally, a comparison of transcript levels for 21 genes across seven samples measured by the nCounter system and SYBR Green real-time PCR demonstrated similar patterns of gene expression at all transcript levels.},

	doi = {10.1126/science.145.3639.1399},
	abstract = {A rapid, sensitive method is described for measuring C(14)-aminoacyl-sRNA interactions with ribosomes which are specifically induced by the appropriate RNA codewords prior to peptide-bond formation. Properties of the codeword recognition process and the minimum oligonucleotide chain length required to induce such interactions are presented. The trinucleotides, pUpUpU, pApApA, and pCpCpC, but not dinucleotides, specifically direct the binding to ribosomes of phenylalanine-, lysine-, and proline-sRNA, respectively. Since 5'-terminal, 3'-terminal, and internal codewords differ in chemical structure, three corresponding classes of codewords are proposed. The recognition of each class in this system is described. The template efficiency of trinucleotide codewords is modified greatly by terminal phosphate. Triplets with 5'-terminal phosphate are more active as templates than triplets without terminal phosphate. Triplets with 3'- or 3' (2')-terminal phosphate are markedly less active as templates. These findings are discussed in relation to the probable functions of terminal codewords. The modification of RNA and DNA codewords, converting sense into missense or nonsense codewords, is suggested as a possible regulatory mechanism in protein synthesis.},

This hypothesis explains cellular differentiation (multicellular organism) through constitutional variations of cytoplasmic ribonucleic acids.

	abstract = {The need to evaluate treatment effectiveness is ubiquitous in most of empirical science, and interest in flexibly investigating effect heterogeneity is growing rapidly. To do so, a multitude of model-agnostic, nonparametric meta-learners have been proposed in recent years. Such learners decompose the treatment effect estimation problem into separate sub-problems, each solvable using standard supervised learning methods. Choosing between different meta-learners in a datadriven manner is difficult, as it requires access to counterfactual information. Therefore, with the ultimate goal of building better understanding of the conditions under which some learners can be expected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically analyze four broad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and pseudo-outcome regression. We highlight how this theoretical reasoning can be used to guide principled algorithm design and translate our analyses into practice by considering a variety of neural network architectures as base-learners for the discussed metalearning strategies. In a simulation study, we showcase the relative strengths of the learners under different data-generating processes.},

When the distribution of survival data is known or it is appropriate to assume a survival distribution,use of a parametric form of Cox model is employed. In this article,we take into account Cox-Gompertz model from the Bayesian perspective. Considering the difficulties in parameter es-timation in classical setting,we propose a simple Bayesian approach for Cox-Gompertz model. We derive full conditional posterior distributions of all parameters in Cox-Gompertz model to run Gibbs sampling. Over an extensive simulation study,estimation accuracies of the classical Cox model and classical and Bayesian settings of Cox-Gompertz model are compared with each other by generating exponential,Weibull,and Gompertz distributed survival data sets. Consequently,if survival data follows Gompertz distribution,most accurate parameter estimates are obtained by the Bayesian setting of Cox-Gompertz model. We also provide a real data analysis to illustrate our approach. In the data analysis,we observe the importance of use of the most accurate model over the survival probabilities of censored observations.},

Both multitargeted and highly selective kinase inhibitors are used for the treatment of advanced treatment-resistant cancers, and many have also achieved regulatory approval for early clinical settings as adjuvant therapies or as first-line options for recurrent or metastatic disease. Lessons learned from the development of these agents can accelerate the development of next-generation inhibitors to optimise the therapeutic index, overcome drug resistance, and establish combination therapies. The future of small molecule inhibitors is promising as there is the potential to investigate novel difficult-to-drug targets, to apply predictive non-clinical models to select promising drug candidates for human evaluation, and to use dynamic clinical trial interventions with liquid biopsies to deliver precision medicine.},

Their loss-of-function mutations are related directly to tumorigenesis. Thus, use of tumor-suppressor genes as anticancer therapeutics has been investigated rigorously in both experimental and clinical researches. Transfer of various tumor-suppressor genes directly to cancer cells has been demonstrated to suppress tumor growth via induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest and, in some cases, with evidence for bystander effects. Various studies also have shown that combination of tumor-suppressor gene therapy with conventional anticancer therapy can yield synergistic therapeutic benefits. Clinical trials with tumor-suppressor genes, especially the p53 gene, have demonstrated that the treatment is well tolerated, and; favorable clinical responses, including a pathologically complete responses, have been observed in a subset of patients with advanced disease or with cancers resistant to conventional therapy. Yet, current gene replacement approaches in cancer gene therapy must be improved if they are to have a broader clinical impact. Efficient systemic gene delivery systems will be required ultimately for treatment of metastatic disease.

Recent advances in genome-wide profiling provide an opportunity to investigate global molecular changes during the development and progression of cancer.

Molecular subtyping studies have allowed the allocation of cancer into homogeneous groups that are considered to harbor similar molecular and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, this has helped researchers to identify both actionable targets for drug design as well as biomarkers for response prediction. In this review, we introduce five frequently applied techniques for generating molecular data, which are microarray, RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, NanoString and tissue microarray. Commonly used molecular data for cancer subtyping and clinical applications are discussed. Next, we summarize a workflow for molecular subtyping of cancer, including data preprocessing, cluster analysis, supervised classification and subtype characterizations. Finally, we identify and describe four major challenges in the molecular subtyping of cancer that may preclude clinical implementation. We suggest that standardized methods should be established to help identify intrinsic subgroup signatures and build robust classifiers that pave the way toward stratified treatment of cancer patients.},

Taking advantage of recent clinical development advances and rapid growth in GWAS datasets, we extend the original work using updated data, test whether genetic evidence predicts future successes and introduce statistical models adjusting for target and indication-level properties. Our work confirms drugs with genetically supported targets were more likely to be successful in Phases II and III. When causal genes are clear (Mendelian traits and GWAS associations linked to coding variants), we find the use of human genetic evidence increases approval by greater than two-fold, and, for Mendelian associations, the positive association holds prospectively.

	abstract = {Heterogeneous effect estimation plays a crucial role in causal inference, with applications across medicine and social science. Many methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in recent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and when such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has nontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in several main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and give a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields sharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to derive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and give sufficient conditions for oracle efficiency. Underlying our error bound is a general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes, which is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The third contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits of CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial adaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be oracle efficient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form of sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters. These are the weakest conditions currently found in the literature, and we conjecture that they are minimal in a minimax sense. We go on to give error bounds in the non-trivial regime where oracle rates cannot be achieved. Some finite-sample properties are explored with simulations.},

One approach is to model the relationships between the covariates and the outcome and use those relationships to predict the missing values. Another is to model the probabilities of missingness given the covariates and incorporate them into a weighted or stratified estimate. Doubly robust (DR) procedures apply both types of model simultaneously and produce a consistent estimate of the parameter if either of the two models has been correctly specified. In this article, we show that DR estimates can be constructed in many ways. We compare the performance of various DR and non-DR estimates of a population mean in a simulated example where both models are incorrect but neither is grossly misspecified. Methods that use inverse-probabilities as weights, whether they are DR or not, are sensitive to misspecification of the propensity model when some estimated propensities are small. Many DR methods perform better than simple inverse-probability weighting. None of the DR methods we tried, however, improved upon the performance of simple regression-based prediction of the missing values. This study does not represent every missing-data problem that will arise in practice. But it does demonstrate that, in at least some settings, two wrong models are not better than one.},

	abstract = {The difference-in-differences (DID) estimator is one of the most popular tools for applied research in economics to evaluate the effects of public interventions and other treatments of interest on some relevant outcome variables. However, it is well known that the DID estimator is based on strong identifying assumptions. In particular, the conventional DID estimator requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the average outcomes for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time. This assumption may be implausible if pre-treatment characteristics that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable are unbalanced between the treated and the untreated. That would be the case, for example, if selection for treatment is influenced by individual-transitory shocks on past outcomes (Ashenfelter's dip). This article considers the case in which differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between treated and controls. It is shown that, in such a case, a simple two-step strategy can be used to estimate the average effect of the treatment for the treated. In addition, the estimation framework proposed in this article allows the use of covariates to describe how the average effect of the treatment varies with changes in observed characteristics.},

	abstract = {Population health interventions are essential to reduce health inequalities and tackle other public health priorities, but they are not always amenable to experimental manipulation. Natural experiment (NE) approaches are attracting growing interest as a way of providing evidence in such circumstances. One key challenge in evaluating NEs is selective exposure to the intervention. Studies should be based on a clear theoretical understanding of the processes that determine exposure. Even if the observed effects are large and rapidly follow implementation, confidence in attributing these effects to the intervention can be improved by carefully considering alternative explanations. Causal inference can be strengthened by including additional design features alongside the principal method of effect estimation. NE studies often rely on existing (including routinely collected) data. Investment in such data sources and the infrastructure for linking exposure and outcome data is essential if the potential for such studies to inform decision making is to be realized.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2004.14497},
	abstract = {Heterogeneous effect estimation plays a crucial role in causal inference, with applications across medicine and social science. Many methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in recent years, but there are important theoretical gaps in understanding if and when such methods are optimal. This is especially true when the CATE has nontrivial structure (e.g., smoothness or sparsity). Our work contributes in several main ways. First, we study a two-stage doubly robust CATE estimator and give a generic model-free error bound, which, despite its generality, yields sharper results than those in the current literature. We apply the bound to derive error rates in nonparametric models with smoothness or sparsity, and give sufficient conditions for oracle efficiency. Underlying our error bound is a general oracle inequality for regression with estimated or imputed outcomes, which is of independent interest; this is the second main contribution. The third contribution is aimed at understanding the fundamental statistical limits of CATE estimation. To that end, we propose and study a local polynomial adaptation of double-residual regression. We show that this estimator can be oracle efficient under even weaker conditions, if used with a specialized form of sample splitting and careful choices of tuning parameters. These are the weakest conditions currently found in the literature, and we conjecture that they are minimal in a minimax sense. We go on to give error bounds in the non-trivial regime where oracle rates cannot be achieved. Some finite-sample properties are explored with simulations.},

The completeness proofs of [Huang and Valtorta, 2006] and [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006] and the graphical criteria of [Tian and Shpitser, 2010] have laid this identification problem to rest. Recent explorations unveil the usefulness of the do-calculus in three additional areas : mediation analysis [Pearl, 2012], transportability [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] and meta-synthesis. Meta-synthesis (freshly coined) is the task of fusing empirical results from several diverse studies, conducted on heterogeneous populations and under different conditions, so as to synthesize an estimate of a causal relation in some target environment, potentially different from those under study. The talk surveys these results with emphasis on the challenges posed by meta-synthesis. For background material, see (http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/csl\_papers.html).},

The algorithms learn a "balanced" representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look similar, and we give a novel and intuitive generalization-error bound showing the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances.

However, it remains unclear what factors affect LAMP’s quantitative resolution, and experimental optimization of primers presents a major bottleneck in assay design. A lack of model-based frameworks to characterize LAMP data and address these questions presents an unmet need for LAMP assay development.
Results We present hierarchical Bayesian models of LAMP amplification based on Gompertz functions, and use these models to infer the effect of RNA variation and other factors on LAMP amplification curves derived from 80 blood samples of patients with suspected acute infection. Our analysis uncovers associations between LAMP assay resolution and characteristics such as primer sequence composition and thermodynamic properties. In addition to correlations between RNA input abundance and time shift of the the LAMP amplification curve, we also detect RNA-dependent assocations with amplification rate. We further investigate associations between primer/target properties and quantitative performance of the assay by generating a set of synthetic RNA samples with systematically varied primer sequences and applying our framework. We find evidence that the associations observed are driven by across-target rather than within-target variation, an important observation for study design. Our findings represent important first steps towards guided development of quantitative LAMP assays.

Our first goal is to develop a generative model for the profile of mutation across the exome, which allows for gene- and variant type-dependent mutation rates. Based on this model, we then propose a procedure for constructing biomarker estimators. Our approach allows the practitioner to select a targeted gene panel of prespecified size and construct an estimator that only depends on the selected genes. Alternatively, our method may be applied to make predictions based on an existing gene panel, or to augment a gene panel to a given size. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposal using data from three non small-cell lung cancer studies, as well as data from six other cancer types.},

Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumor's response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach. We name our method "Tybalt" after an instigative, cat-like character who sets a cascading chain of events in motion in Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet".

Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we provide with a better comprehension of VAEs in tasks such as high-resolution reconstruction, and representation learning in the perspective of Fisher information and Shannon information.

Imposing additional constraints with strong and biologically motivated regularizations is critical in developing reliable and effective algorithms for inferring gene expression programs. Here we propose a new form of regulation that constrains the number of independent connectivity patterns between regulators and targets, motivated by the modular design of gene regulatory programs and the belief that the total number of independent regulatory modules should be small. We formulate a multi-target linear regression framework to incorporate this type of regulation, in which the number of independent connectivity patterns is expressed as the rank of the connectivity matrix between regulators and targets. We then generalize the linear framework to nonlinear cases, and prove that the generalized low-rank regularization model is still convex. Efficient algorithms are derived to solve both the linear and nonlinear low-rank regularized problems. Finally, we test the algorithms on three gene expression datasets, and show that the low-rank regularization improves the accuracy of gene expression prediction in these three datasets.},

In order to construct a bridge between practical applications and theoretical studies, in this paper we provide a comprehensive survey for LRR. Specifically, we first review the recent advances in two issues that all LRR models are faced with: (1) rank-norm relaxation, which seeks to find a relaxation to replace the rank minimization problem; (2) model optimization, which seeks to use an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the relaxed LRR models. For the first issue, we provide a detailed summarization for various relaxation functions and conclude that the non-convex relaxations can alleviate the punishment bias problem compared with the convex relaxations. For the second issue, we summarize the representative optimization algorithms used in previous studies, and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. As the main goal of this paper is to promote the application of non-convex relaxations, we conduct extensive experiments to compare different relaxation functions. The experimental results demonstrate that the non-convex relaxations generally provide a large advantage over the convex relaxations. Such a result is inspiring for further improving the performance of existing LRR models.},

An estimate of the inverse covariance matrix is obtained by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data, under a multivariate normal model, subject to a penalty; it is then used to estimate coefficients for the regression of the response onto the features. We show that ridge regression, the lasso and the elastic net are special cases of covariance-regularized regression, and we demonstrate that certain previously unexplored forms of covariance-regularized regression can outperform existing methods in a range of situations.

	abstract = {The Cox proportional hazards regression model is the most popular approach to model covariate information for survival times. In this context, the development of high-dimensional models where the number of covariates is much larger than the number of observations (p{\textgreater}{\textgreater}n) is an ongoing challenge. A practicable approach is to use ridge penalized Cox regression in such situations. Beside focussing on finding the best prediction rule, one is often interested in determining a subset of covariates that are the most important ones for prognosis. This could be a gene set in the biostatistical analysis of microarray data. Covariate selection can then, for example, be done by L(1)-penalized Cox regression using the lasso (Tibshirani (1997). Statistics in Medicine 16, 385-395). Several approaches beyond the lasso, that incorporate covariate selection, have been developed in recent years. This includes modifications of the lasso as well as nonconvex variants such as smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) (Fan and Li (2001). Journal of the American Statistical Association 96, 1348-1360; Fan and Li (2002). The Annals of Statistics 30, 74-99). The purpose of this article is to implement them practically into the model building process when analyzing high-dimensional data with the Cox proportional hazards model. To evaluate penalized regression models beyond the lasso, we included SCAD variants and the adaptive lasso (Zou (2006). Journal of the American Statistical Association 101, 1418-1429). We compare them with "standard" applications such as ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net. Predictive accuracy, features of variable selection, and estimation bias will be studied to assess the practical use of these methods. We observed that the performance of SCAD and adaptive lasso is highly dependent on nontrivial preselection procedures. A practical solution to this problem does not yet exist. Since there is high risk of missing relevant covariates when using SCAD or adaptive lasso applied after an inappropriate initial selection step, we recommend to stay with lasso or the elastic net in actual data applications. But with respect to the promising results for truly sparse models, we see some advantage of SCAD and adaptive lasso, if better preselection procedures would be available. This requires further methodological research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improvements to prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have the potential to augment clinical trial design and guide treatment strategies. In partnership with Project Data Sphere, a not-for-profit initiative allowing data from cancer clinical trials to be shared broadly with researchers, we designed an open-data, crowdsourced, DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge to not only identify a better prognostic model for prediction of survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer but also engage a community of international data scientists to study this disease.
METHODS: Data from the comparator arms of four phase 3 clinical trials in first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were obtained from Project Data Sphere, comprising 476 patients treated with docetaxel and prednisone from the ASCENT2 trial, 526 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo in the MAINSAIL trial, 598 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone or prednisolone, and placebo in the VENICE trial, and 470 patients treated with docetaxel and placebo in the ENTHUSE 33 trial. Datasets consisting of more than 150 clinical variables were curated centrally, including demographics, laboratory values, medical history, lesion sites, and previous treatments. Data from ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE were released publicly to be used as training data to predict the outcome of interest-namely, overall survival. Clinical data were also released for ENTHUSE 33, but data for outcome variables (overall survival and event status) were hidden from the challenge participants so that ENTHUSE 33 could be used for independent validation. Methods were evaluated using the integrated time-dependent area under the curve (iAUC). The reference model, based on eight clinical variables and a penalised Cox proportional-hazards model, was used to compare method performance. Further validation was done using data from a fifth trial-ENTHUSE M1-in which 266 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with placebo alone.
FINDINGS: 50 independent methods were developed to predict overall survival and were evaluated through the DREAM challenge. The top performer was based on an ensemble of penalised Cox regression models (ePCR), which uniquely identified predictive interaction effects with immune biomarkers and markers of hepatic and renal function. Overall, ePCR outperformed all other methods (iAUC 0·791; Bayes factor {\textgreater}5) and surpassed the reference model (iAUC 0·743; Bayes factor {\textgreater}20). Both the ePCR model and reference models stratified patients in the ENTHUSE 33 trial into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival (ePCR: hazard ratio 3·32, 95\% CI 2·39-4·62, p{\textless}0·0001; reference model: 2·56, 1·85-3·53, p{\textless}0·0001). The new model was validated further on the ENTHUSE M1 cohort with similarly high performance (iAUC 0·768). Meta-analysis across all methods confirmed previously identified predictive clinical variables and revealed aspartate aminotransferase as an important, albeit previously under-reported, prognostic biomarker.
INTERPRETATION: Novel prognostic factors were delineated, and the assessment of 50 methods developed by independent international teams establishes a benchmark for development of methods in the future. The results of this effort show that data-sharing, when combined with a crowdsourced challenge, is a robust and powerful framework to develop new prognostic models in advanced prostate cancer.

By integrating gene expression data of GC and normal samples from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus, the EBI ArrayExpress and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repositories, the common RNAs in Genomic Spatial Event (GSE) 65801, GSE29998, E‑MTAB‑1338, and TCGA set were screened and used to construct a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) network for mining GC‑related modules. Consensus differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) between GC and normal samples in the four datasets were screened using the MetaDE method. From the overlapped lncRNAs shared by preserved WGCNA modules and the consensus DERs, an lncRNAs signature was obtained using L1‑penalized (lasso) Cox‑proportional hazard (PH) model. LncRNA‑mRNA networks were constructed for these signature lncRNAs, followed by functional annotation. A total of 14,824 common mRNAs and 2,869 common lncRNAs were identified in the 4 sets and 5 GC‑associated WGCNA modules were preserved across all sets. MetaDE method identified 1,121 consensus DERs. A total of 50 lncRNAs were shared by preserved WGCNA modules and the consensus DERs. Subsequently, an 11‑lncRNA signature was identified by LASSO‑based Cox‑PH model. The lncRNAs signature‑based risk score could divide patients into 2 risk groups with significantly different overall survival and recurrence‑free survival times. The predictive capability of this signature was verified in an independent set. These signature lncRNAs were implicated in several biological processes and pathways associated with the immune response, the inflammatory response and cell cycle control. The present study identified an 11‑lncRNA signature that could predict the survival rate for GC.},

Current strategies depend on conventional mapping, so the propagation of affected mice requires non-lethal screens; accurate tracking of phenotypes through pedigrees is complex and uncertain; out-crossing can introduce unexpected modifiers; and Sanger sequencing of candidate genes is inefficient. Here we show how these problems can be efficiently overcome using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to detect the ENU mutations and then identify regions that are identical by descent (IBD) in multiple affected mice. In this strategy, we use a modification of the Lander-Green algorithm to isolate causative recessive and dominant mutations, even at low coverage, on a pure strain background. Analysis of the IBD regions also allows us to calculate the ENU mutation rate (1.54 mutations per Mb) and to model future strategies for genetic screens in mice. The introduction of this approach will accelerate the discovery of causal variants, permit broader and more informative lethal screens to be used, reduce animal costs, and herald a new era for ENU mutagenesis.},

However, some mutations are more likely to occur than others due to differences in background mutation rates arising from various forms of infidelity of DNA replication and repair machinery, endogenous, and exogenous mutagens. We calculated nucleotide and codon mutability to study the contribution of background processes in shaping the observed mutational spectrum in cancer. We developed and tested probabilistic pan-cancer and cancer-specific models that adjust the number of mutation recurrences in patients by background mutability in order to find mutations which may be under selection in cancer. We showed that mutations with higher mutability values had higher observed recurrence frequency, especially in tumor suppressor genes. This trend was prominent for nonsense and silent mutations or mutations with neutral functional impact. In oncogenes, however, highly recurring mutations were characterized by relatively low mutability, resulting in an inversed U-shaped trend. Mutations not yet observed in any tumor had relatively low mutability values, indicating that background mutability might limit mutation occurrence. We compiled a dataset of missense mutations from 58 genes with experimentally validated functional and transforming impacts from various studies. We found that mutability of driver mutations was lower than that of passengers and consequently adjusting mutation recurrence frequency by mutability significantly improved ranking of mutations and driver mutation prediction. Even though no training on existing data was involved, our approach performed similarly or better to the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, the low frequency of most mutations and the varying rates of mutations across patients makes the data extremely challenging to statistically analyze as well as difficult to use in classification problems, for clustering, visualization or for learning useful information. Thus, the creation of low dimensional representations of somatic mutation profiles that hold useful information about the DNA of cancer cells will facilitate the use of such data in applications that will progress precision medicine. In this paper, we talk about the open problem of learning from somatic mutations, and present Flatsomatic: a solution that utilizes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to create latent representations of somatic profiles. The work done in this paper shows great potential for this method, with the VAE embeddings performing better than PCA for a clustering task, and performing equally well to the raw high dimensional data for a classification task.

We compared two different neural network architectures for the VAE: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and bidirectional LSTM. The somatic profiles we used to train our models consisted of 8,062 Pan-Cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 989 cell lines from the COSMIC cell line project. The profiles for each patient were represented by the genomic loci where somatic mutations occurred and, to reduce sparsity, the locations with a frequency {\textless}5 were removed. We enhanced the VAE performance by changing its evidence lower bound, and devised an F1-score based loss showing that it helps the VAE learn better than with binary cross-entropy. We also employed beta-VAE to weight the variational regularisation term in the loss function and showed the best performance through a preliminary function to increase the weight of the regularisation term with each epoch. We assessed the reconstruction ability of the VAE using the micro F1-score metric and showed that our best performing model was a 2-layer deep MLP VAE. Our analysis also showed that the size of the latent space did not have a significant effect on the VAE learning ability. We compared the Flatsomatic embeddings created to a lower dimension version of the data from principal component analysis, showing superior performance of Flatsomatic, and performed K-means clustering on both datasets to draw comparisons to known cancer types of each profile. Finally, we present results that confirm that the Flatsomatic representations of 64 dimensions maintain the same predictive power as the original 8,298 dimensions vector, through prediction of drug response.},

At present, most of the image recognition methods use artificial feature extraction which is not only laborious, time consuming, but also difficult to do. Deep convolutional neural network is becoming a research hotspot in recent years. It has successfully applied to character recognition, face recognition, and so on. The traditional deep convolutional neural network still has some defaults when dealing with large-scale images and high-resolution complex images. So many research works are rolling ahead to improve the network to make it more efficient and robust. Firstly, the principle of the traditional convolutional neural network was briefly introduced. Then, the improvements on convolutional layer, pooling layer, activation function of convolutional neural network in recent years were summarized. Its applications in image recognition were also presented. Finally, the challenges in convolutional neural network research were analyzed and our recent works ware introduced.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In 2008, we initiated a prospective study to explore the frequency and predictive value of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in an unselected population of Danish patients with non-small cell lung cancer offered treatment with erlotinib, mainly in second-line.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred and eighty eight patients with advanced NSCLC were included. The mutation status was assessed using the cobas EGFR Mutation Test. Erlotinib was administrated (150 mg/d) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occurred. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and response.
RESULTS: Biopsies were retrieved from 467 patients, and mutation results obtained for 462. We identified 57 (12\%) patients with EGFR mutations: 33 exon 19 deletions, 13 exon 21 mutations, 5 exon 18 mutations, 3 exon 20 insertions, 1 exon 20 point mutation (S768I), and two complex mutations. Seven percent of the patients were never smokers. The differences in median progression-free survival and overall survival between the mutated group and the wild-type group were 8.0 vs. 2.5 months, p{\textless}0.001 and 12.1 vs. 3.9 months, p{\textless}0.001. Performance status (0-1 vs. 2-3) and line of treatment (1st vs. 2nd and 3rd) had no influence on outcome in EGFR-mutated patients.
CONCLUSION: We found a higher frequency of EGFR mutations than expected in a cohort with less than 10\% never smokers. The outcome after treatment with erlotinib was much better in patients with EGFR mutations than in patients with wild-type EGFR and was independent of performance status and treatment line in EGFR-mutated patients.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {Genomic sequencing has undergone massive expansion in the past 10 yr, from a rarely used research tool into an approach that has broad applications in a clinical setting. From rare disease to cancer, genomics is transforming our knowledge of biology. The transition from targeted gene sequencing, to whole exome sequencing, to whole genome sequencing has only been made possible due to rapid advancements in technologies and informatics that have plummeted the cost per base of DNA sequencing and analysis. The tools of genomics have resolved the etiology of disease for previously undiagnosable conditions, identified cancer driver gene variants, and have impacted the understanding of pathophysiology for many diseases. However, this expansion of use has also highlighted research's current voids in knowledge. The lack of precise animal models for gene-to-function association, lack of tools for analysis of genomic structural changes, skew in populations used for genetic studies, publication biases, and the "Unknown Proteome" all contribute to voids needing filled for genomics to work in a fast-paced clinical setting. The future will hold the tools to fill in these voids, with new data sets and the continual development of new technologies allowing for expansion of genomic medicine, ushering in the days to come for precision medicine. In this review we highlight these and other points in hopes of advancing and guiding precision medicine into the future for optimal success.},

	abstract = {Our intuition regarding “average” is rooted in one-dimensional thinking, such as the distribution of height across a population. This intuition breaks down in higher dimensions when multiple measurements are combined: fewer individuals are close to average for many measurements simultaneously than for any single measurement alone. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality. In medicine, diagnostic sophistication generally increases through the addition of more predictive factors. Disease classes themselves become more dissimilar as a result, increasing the difficulty of incorporating (i.e., averaging) multiple patients into a single class for guiding treatment of new patients. Failure to consider the curse of dimensionality will ultimately lead to inherent limits on the degree to which precision medicine can extend the advances of evidence-based medicine for selecting suitable treatments. One strategy to compensate for the curse of dimensionality involves incorporating predictive observation models into the patient workup.},

Mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in non-small-cell lung cancer and of BRAF in melanoma provide great examples of driver mutations defining patient subgroups that respond to specific therapeutic agents. Recent advances in genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing offer new opportunities for discovery and development of targeted therapies. They also pose numerous challenges in implementing molecularly guided precision medicine in clinical care. In this article, we review how molecular diagnostics have evolved over recent decades, discuss types and capabilities of clinically applicable genomic technologies, and highlight examples of companion diagnostics that have gained regulatory approval.

However, approaches that account for survival outcomes are relatively limited. Survival data are frequently encountered across diverse medical applications, i.e., drug development, risk profiling, and clinical trials, and such data are also relevant in fields like manufacturing (e.g., for equipment monitoring). When the outcome of interest is a time-to-event, special precautions for handling censored events need to be taken, as ignoring censored outcomes may lead to biased estimates. We propose a theoretically grounded unified framework for counterfactual inference applicable to survival outcomes. Further, we formulate a nonparametric hazard ratio metric for evaluating average and individualized treatment effects. Experimental results on real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, the latter of which we introduce, demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms competitive alternatives in both survival-outcome prediction and treatment-effect estimation.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms—such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks—to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.},

Here, we explore the accuracy of the IMX-BVN-3/IMX-SEV-3 29 mRNA host response classifiers in simultaneously detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and bacterial coinfections and predicting clinical severity of COVID-19. A total of 161 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (52.2\% female; median age, 50.0 years; 51\% hospitalized; 5.6\% deaths) were enrolled at the Stanford Hospital ED. RNA was extracted (2.5 mL whole blood in PAXgene blood RNA), and 29 host mRNAs in response to the infection were quantified using Nanostring nCounter. The IMX-BVN-3 classifier identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in 151 patients with a sensitivity of 93.8\%. Six of 10 patients undetected by the classifier had positive COVID tests more than 9 days prior to enrollment, and the remaining patients oscillated between positive and negative results in subsequent tests. The classifier also predicted that 6 (3.7\%) patients had a bacterial coinfection. Clinical adjudication confirmed that 5/6 (83.3\%) of the patients had bacterial infections, i.e., Clostridioides difficile colitis (n = 1), urinary tract infection (n = 1), and clinically diagnosed bacterial infections (n = 3), for a specificity of 99.4\%. Two of 101 (2.8\%) patients in the IMX-SEV-3 “Low” severity classification and 7/60 (11.7\%) in the “Moderate” severity classification died within 30 days of enrollment. IMX-BVN-3/IMX-SEV-3 classifiers accurately identified patients with COVID-19 and bacterial coinfections and predicted patients’ risk of death. A point-of-care version of these classifiers, under development, could improve ED patient management, including more accurate treatment decisions and optimized resource utilization.
IMPORTANCE We assay the utility of the single-test IMX-BVN-3/IMX-SEV-3 classifiers that require just 2.5 mL of patient blood in concurrently detecting viral and bacterial infections as well as predicting the severity and 30-day outcome from the infection. A point-of-care device, in development, will circumvent the need for blood culturing and drastically reduce the time needed to detect an infection. This will negate the need for empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and allow for antibiotic use stewardship. Additionally, accurate classification of the severity of infection and the prediction of 30-day severe outcomes will allow for appropriate allocation of hospital resources.},

	abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization-Egger (MR-Egger) is an analysis method for Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data. MR-Egger consists of three parts: (1) a test for directional pleiotropy, (2) a test for a causal effect, and (3) an estimate of the causal effect. While conventional analysis methods for Mendelian randomization assume that all genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable assumptions, the MR-Egger method is able to assess whether genetic variants have pleiotropic effects on the outcome that differ on average from zero (directional pleiotropy), as well as to provide a consistent estimate of the causal effect, under a weaker assumption—the InSIDE (INstrument Strength Independent of Direct Effect) assumption. In this paper, we provide a critical assessment of the MR-Egger method with regard to its implementation and interpretation. While the MR-Egger method is a worthwhile sensitivity analysis for detecting violations of the instrumental variable assumptions, there are several reasons why causal estimates from the MR-Egger method may be biased and have inflated Type 1 error rates in practice, including violations of the InSIDE assumption and the influence of outlying variants. The issues raised in this paper have potentially serious consequences for causal inferences from the MR-Egger approach. We give examples of scenarios in which the estimates from conventional Mendelian randomization methods and MR-Egger differ, and discuss how to interpret findings in such cases.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

We propose a method (called SMR) that integrates summary-level data from GWAS with data from expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to identify genes whose expression levels are associated with a complex trait because of pleiotropy. We apply the method to five human complex traits using GWAS data on up to 339,224 individuals and eQTL data on 5,311 individuals, and we prioritize 126 genes (for example, TRAF1 and ANKRD55 for rheumatoid arthritis and SNX19 and NMRAL1 for schizophrenia), of which 25 genes are new candidates; 77 genes are not the nearest annotated gene to the top associated GWAS SNP. These genes provide important leads to design future functional studies to understand the mechanism whereby DNA variation leads to complex trait variation.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic instrumental variables to obtain causal inferences from observational data. Two recent developments for combining information on multiple uncorrelated instrumental variables (IVs) into a single causal estimate are as follows: (i) allele scores, in which individual‐level data on the IVs are aggregated into a univariate score, which is used as a single IV, and (ii) a summary statistic method, in which causal estimates calculated from each IV using summarized data are combined in an inverse‐variance weighted meta‐analysis. To avoid bias from weak instruments, unweighted and externally weighted allele scores have been recommended. Here, we propose equivalent approaches using summarized data and also provide extensions of the methods for use with correlated IVs. We investigate the impact of different choices of weights on the bias and precision of estimates in simulation studies. We show that allele score estimates can be reproduced using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor and the outcome. Estimates from the summary statistic method using external weights are biased towards the null when the weights are imprecisely estimated; in contrast, allele score estimates are unbiased. With equal or external weights, both methods provide appropriate tests of the null hypothesis of no causal effect even with large numbers of potentially weak instruments. We illustrate these methods using summarized data on the causal effect of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary heart disease risk. It is shown that a more precise causal estimate can be obtained using multiple genetic variants from a single gene region, even if the variants are correlated. © 2015 The Authors.

Here, we focus on two-sample summary-data Mendelian randomization analyses with many correlated variants from a single gene region, and particularly on cis-Mendelian randomization studies which use protein expression as a risk factor. Such studies must rely on a small, curated set of variants from the studied region; using all variants in the region requires inverting an ill-conditioned genetic correlation matrix and results in numerically unstable causal effect estimates. We review methods for variable selection and estimation in cis-Mendelian randomization with summary-level data, ranging from stepwise pruning and conditional analysis to principal components analysis, factor analysis and Bayesian variable selection. In a simulation study, we show that the various methods have a comparable performance in analyses with large sample sizes and strong genetic instruments. However, when weak instrument bias is suspected, factor analysis and Bayesian variable selection produce more reliable inferences than simple pruning approaches, which are often used in practice. We conclude by examining two case studies, assessing the effects of LDL-cholesterol and serum testosterone on coronary heart disease risk using variants in the HMGCR and SHBG gene regions respectively.},

To understand the consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we apply an integrated approach that links genetic variation with biological pathway, disease, and drug databases. We show that protein quantitative trait loci overlap with gene expression quantitative trait loci, as well as with disease-associated loci, and find evidence that protein biomarkers have causal roles in disease using Mendelian randomization analysis.

Here we present a binary file format (the BGEN format) that can store both directly-typed and statistically imputed genotype data, and achieves substantial space savings by data compression and the use of an efficient representation for probabilities. We investigate the properties of this format using imputed data from the UK BiLEVE study, demonstrating both storage efficiency, and fast data loading performance on the order of hundreds of millions of imputed genotypes per second. To make using BGEN as easy as possible, we provide a detailed specification and a freely available reference implementation, and we leverage this by developing additional tools including an indexing tool (bgenix) and an R package (rbgen) that permits loading of BGEN-encoded data into the R statistical programming environment. The UK Biobank is one of a number of projects that have used BGEN for release of imputed data, and we expect the format to continue to be widely implemented and used.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis is an important tool to elucidate the causal relevance of environmental and biological risk factors for disease. However, causal inference is undermined if genetic variants used to instrument a risk factor also influence alternative disease-pathways (horizontal pleiotropy). Here we report how the ‘no horizontal pleiotropy assumption’ is strengthened when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are typically the proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome. Moreover, proteins are the targets of most medicines, so MR studies of drug targets are becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies, we introduce a mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to disease. We illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework for maximising power and evaluating the robustness of analyses.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with complex traits, but their biological interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene–trait associations, 36\% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections. TWMR better accounts for pleiotropy and has the potential to identify biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Efforts to prevent depression, the leading cause of disability worldwide, have focused on a limited number of candidate factors. Using phenotypic and genomic data from over 100,000 UK Biobank participants, the authors sought to systematically screen and validate a wide range of potential modifiable factors for depression.

Methods:

Baseline data were extracted for 106 modifiable factors, including lifestyle (e.g., exercise, sleep, media, diet), social (e.g., support, engagement), and environmental (e.g., green space, pollution) variables. Incident depression was defined as minimal depressive symptoms at baseline and clinically significant depression at follow-up. At-risk individuals for incident depression were identified by polygenic risk scores or by reported traumatic life events. An exposure-wide association scan was conducted to identify factors associated with incident depression in the full sample and among at-risk individuals. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was then used to validate potentially causal relationships between identified factors and depression.

Results:

Numerous factors across social, sleep, media, dietary, and exercise-related domains were prospectively associated with depression, even among at-risk individuals. However, only a subset of factors was supported by Mendelian randomization evidence, including confiding in others (odds ratio=0.76, 95\% CI=0.67, 0.86), television watching time (odds ratio=1.09, 95\% CI=1.05, 1.13), and daytime napping (odds ratio=1.34, 95\% CI=1.17, 1.53).

Conclusions:

Using a two-stage approach, this study validates several actionable targets for preventing depression. It also demonstrates that not all factors associated with depression in observational research may translate into robust targets for prevention. A large-scale exposure-wide approach combined with genetically informed methods for causal inference may help prioritize strategies for multimodal prevention in psychiatry.},

Using body mass index (BMI) as an exemplar, we demonstrate a novel extension to the phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) approach, using automated screening with genotypic instruments to screen for causal associations amongst any number of phenotypic outcomes. We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each phenotype. We found 21 of the 172 outcomes were associated with the allele score at an unadjusted p {\textless} 0.05 threshold and use Bonferroni corrections, permutation testing and estimates of the false discovery rate to consider the strength of results given the number of tests performed. The most strongly associated outcomes included leptin, lipid profile and blood pressure. We also found novel evidence of effects of BMI on a global self-worth score.},

We estimate the individual and joint effects of BMI, WHR, and WHR adjusted for BMI. We also implement multivariable instrumental variable methods in which the causal effect of one exposure is estimated conditionally on the causal effect of another exposure. Data on 310,471 participants and over 550,000 inpatient admissions in the UK Biobank were used to perform one-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. The results supported a causal role of adiposity on hospital admissions, with consistency across all estimates and sensitivity analyses. Point estimates were generally larger than estimates from comparable observational specifications. We observed an attenuation of the BMI effect when adjusting for WHR in the multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses, suggesting that an adverse fat distribution, rather than a higher BMI itself, may drive the relationship between adiposity and risk of hospital admission.},

In particular, how robust this estimation is in terms of a commonly varying factors: the instrument used, the number of technical replicates performed and the effect of the volume transferred throughout the dilution series. We used six different qPCR instruments, we performed 1–16 qPCR replicates per concentration and we tested 2–10 μl volume of analyte transferred, respectively. We find that the estimated PCR efficiency varies significantly across different instruments. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we find the uncertainty in the PCR efficiency estimation may be as large as 42.5\% (95\% CI) if standard curve with only one qPCR replicate is used in 16 different plates. Based on our investigation we propose recommendations for the precise estimation of PCR efficiency: (1) one robust standard curve with at least 3–4 qPCR replicates at each concentration shall be generated, (2) the efficiency is instrument dependent, but reproducibly stable on one platform, and (3) using a larger volume when constructing serial dilution series reduces sampling error and enables calibration across a wider dynamic range.},

	abstract = {The application of isothermal amplification technologies is rapidly expanding and currently covers different areas such as infectious disease, genetic disorder and drug dosage adjustment. Meanwhile, many of such technologies have complex reaction processes and often require a fine-tuned primer set where existing primer design tools are not sufficient. We have developed a primer selection system for one important primer, the turn-back primer (TP), which is commonly used in loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) and smart amplification process (SmartAmp). We chose 78 parameters related to the primer and target sequence, and explored their relationship to amplification speed using experimental data for 1344 primer combinations. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for parameter selection and estimation of their numerical coefficients. We subsequently evaluated our prediction model using additional independent experiments and compared to the LAMP primer design tool, Primer Explorer version4 (PE4). The evaluation showed that our approach yields a superior primer design in isothermal amplification and is robust against variations in the experimental setup. Our LASSO regression analysis revealed that availability of the 3′- and 5′-end of the primer are particularly important factors for efficient isothermal amplification.

The impact of these PDFs on probe performance was evaluated using four sets of microarray comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) data, which included two array manufacturing methods and the genomes of two species. Since most of the hybridizing DNA is equimolar in CGH data, such data are ideal for testing the general hybridization properties of almost all candidate oligonucleotides. In all our data sets, PDFs related to probe secondary structure (PMFE, hairpin score and dimer score) are the most significant factors linearly correlated with probe hybridization intensities. PHFE, homology and complexity score are correlating significantly with probe specificities, but in a non-linear fashion. We developed a new PDF, pseudo probe binding energy (PPBE), by iteratively fitting dinucleotide positional weights and dinucleotide stacking energies until the average residue sum of squares for the model was minimized. PPBE showed a better correlation with probe sensitivity and a better specificity than all other PDFs, although training data are required to construct a PPBE model prior to designing new oligonucleotide probes. The physical properties that are measured by PPBE are as yet unknown but include a platform-dependent component. A practical way to use these PDFs for probe design is to set cutoff thresholds to filter out bad quality probes.

Using these data, we identified clinically relevant somatic mutations, novel noncoding alterations, and mutational signatures that were shared by common and rare tumor types. Patients were enrolled on genomically matched clinical trials at a rate of 11\%. To enable discovery of novel biomarkers and deeper investigation into rare alterations and tumor types, all results are publicly accessible.},

Findings in selected cancer types suggest that tumor mutational burden (TMB) may predict clinical response to ICI. To examine this association more broadly, we analyzed the clinical and genomic data of 1,662 advanced cancer patients treated with ICI, and 5,371 non-ICI-treated patients, whose tumors underwent targeted next-generation sequencing (MSK-IMPACT). Among all patients, higher somatic TMB (highest 20\% in each histology) was associated with better overall survival. For most cancer histologies, an association between higher TMB and improved survival was observed. The TMB cutpoints associated with improved survival varied markedly between cancer types. These data indicate that TMB is associated with improved survival in patients receiving ICI across a wide variety of cancer types, but that there may not be one universal definition of high TMB.},

	abstract = {Background Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a workhorse laboratory technique for measuring the concentration of a target DNA sequence with high accuracy over a wide dynamic range. The gold standard method for estimating DNA concentrations via qPCR is quantification cycle () standard curve quantification, which requires the time- and labor-intensive construction of a standard curve. In theory, the shape of a qPCR data curve can be used to directly quantify DNA concentration by fitting a model to data; however, current empirical model-based quantification methods are not as reliable as standard curve quantification. Principal Findings We have developed a two-parameter mass action kinetic model of PCR (MAK2) that can be fitted to qPCR data in order to quantify target concentration from a single qPCR assay. To compare the accuracy of MAK2-fitting to other qPCR quantification methods, we have applied quantification methods to qPCR dilution series data generated in three independent laboratories using different target sequences. Quantification accuracy was assessed by analyzing the reliability of concentration predictions for targets at known concentrations. Our results indicate that quantification by MAK2-fitting is as reliable as standard curve quantification for a variety of DNA targets and a wide range of concentrations. Significance We anticipate that MAK2 quantification will have a profound effect on the way qPCR experiments are designed and analyzed. In particular, MAK2 enables accurate quantification of portable qPCR assays with limited sample throughput, where construction of a standard curve is impractical.},

Properly designed primers will increase PCR amplification efficiency as well as isolate the targeted sequence of interest with higher specificity.

For example, primer dimer detection, amplification of alternative products, stem loop interference, extreme melting temperatures, and genotype-specific variations in the target sequence can all be considered computationally to minimize subsequent PCR failures. The use of computational sequence analysis tools to select the best primer pair from the available candidates will not only reduce experimental rates of failure but also avoid the generation of misleading results arising from the amplification of alternative products.},

This routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target distribution that are not well captured by the approximating distribution, in which case more stable estimates can be obtained by modifying extreme importance ratios. We present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method, which empirically performs better than existing methods for stabilizing importance sampling estimates, includes stabilized effective sample size estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates and convergence diagnostics.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (C(p)), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is "command line" driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package.

Tm range compatible with hybridization requirements. Combined with on chip oligonucleotide synthesis, this program makes it
feasible to perform expression analysis on a genomic scale for any organism for which the genome sequence is known. This is

However, existing LAMP primer designing systems require a conserved gene or a short genome region as input, and they can’t design group-specific primers. With the growing number of whole genomes available, it is possible to design better primers to target a set of genomes with high specificity based on whole genomes. We present here a whole Genome based LAMP primer designer (GLAPD), a new system to design LAMP primer for a set of target genomes using whole genomes. Candidate single primer regions are identified genome wide and then combined into LAMP primer sets. For a given set of target genomes, only primer sets amplifying them and only these genomes will be output. In order to accelerate the primer designing, a GPU version is provided as well. The effectiveness of primers designed by GLAPD has been assessed for a wide range of foodborne bacteria.

Several groups have used gene expression microarrays to build classifiers for acute infections, but these have been hampered by the size of the gene sets, use of overfit models, or lack of independent validation. We used multicohort analysis to derive a set of seven genes for robust discrimination of bacterial and viral infections, which we then validated in 30 independent cohorts. We next used our previously published 11-gene Sepsis MetaScore together with the new bacterial/viral classifier to build an integrated antibiotics decision model. In a pooled analysis of 1057 samples from 20 cohorts (excluding infants), the integrated antibiotics decision model had a sensitivity and specificity for bacterial infections of 94.0 and 59.8\%, respectively (negative likelihood ratio, 0.10). Prospective clinical validation will be needed before these findings are implemented for patient care.},

The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

	abstract = {Commonsense AI has long been seen as a near impossible goal -- until recently. Now, research interest has sharply increased with an influx of new benchmarks and models. We propose two new ways to evaluate commonsense models, emphasizing their generality on new tasks and building on diverse, recently introduced benchmarks. First, we propose a new multitask benchmark, RAINBOW, to promote research on commonsense models that generalize well over multiple tasks and datasets. Second, we propose a novel evaluation, the cost equivalent curve, that sheds new insight on how the choice of source datasets, pretrained language models, and transfer learning methods impacts performance and data efficiency. We perform extensive experiments -- over 200 experiments encompassing 4800 models -- and report multiple valuable and sometimes surprising findings, e.g., that transfer almost always leads to better or equivalent performance if following a particular recipe, that QA-based commonsense datasets transfer well with each other, while commonsense knowledge graphs do not, and that perhaps counter-intuitively, larger models benefit more from transfer than smaller ones. Last but not least, we introduce a new universal commonsense reasoning model, UNICORN, that establishes new state-of-the-art performance across 8 popular commonsense benchmarks, aNLI (87.3\%), CosmosQA (91.8\%), HellaSWAG (93.9\%), PIQA (90.1\%), SocialIQa (83.2\%), WinoGrande (86.6\%), CycIC (94.0\%) and CommonsenseQA (79.3\%).},

Motivated by descriptive ethics, a field of study that focuses on people's descriptive judgments rather than theoretical prescriptions on morality, we investigate a novel, data-driven approach to machine ethics. We introduce Scruples, the first large-scale dataset with 625,000 ethical judgments over 32,000 real-life anecdotes. Each anecdote recounts a complex ethical situation, often posing moral dilemmas, paired with a distribution of judgments contributed by the community members. Our dataset presents a major challenge to state-of-the-art neural language models, leaving significant room for improvement. However, when presented with simplified moral situations, the results are considerably more promising, suggesting that neural models can effectively learn simpler ethical building blocks. A key take-away of our empirical analysis is that norms are not always clean-cut; many situations are naturally divisive. We present a new method to estimate the best possible performance on such tasks with inherently diverse label distributions, and explore likelihood functions that separate intrinsic from model uncertainty.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03891},
	abstract = {Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that "we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women," most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker -- that "women (candidates) are less qualified." Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80\% F1), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications.},

Moreover, we examine if models can anticipate likely consequences of (im)moral actions, or explain why certain actions are preferable by generating relevant norms. For this purpose, we introduce 'Moral Stories', a crowd-sourced dataset of structured, branching narratives for the study of grounded, goal-oriented social reasoning.

For example, underlying an action such as "wanting to call cops on my neighbors" are social norms that inform our conduct, such as "It is expected that you report crimes." We present Social Chemistry, a new conceptual formalism to study people's everyday social norms and moral judgments over a rich spectrum of real life situations described in natural language. We introduce Social-Chem-101, a large-scale corpus that catalogs 292k rules-of-thumb such as "it is rude to run a blender at 5am" as the basic conceptual units. Each rule-of-thumb is further broken down with 12 different dimensions of people's judgments, including social judgments of good and bad, moral foundations, expected cultural pressure, and assumed legality, which together amount to over 4.5 million annotations of categorical labels and free-text descriptions. Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural models demonstrate that computational modeling of social norms is a promising research direction. Our model framework, Neural Norm Transformer, learns and generalizes Social-Chem-101 to successfully reason about previously unseen situations, generating relevant (and potentially novel) attribute-aware social rules-of-thumb.},

	abstract = {What would it take to teach a machine to behave ethically? While broad ethical rules may seem straightforward to state ("thou shalt not kill"), applying such rules to real-world situations is far more complex. For example, while "helping a friend" is generally a good thing to do, "helping a friend spread fake news" is not. We identify four underlying challenges towards machine ethics and norms: (1) an understanding of moral precepts and social norms; (2) the ability to perceive real-world situations visually or by reading natural language descriptions; (3) commonsense reasoning to anticipate the outcome of alternative actions in different contexts; (4) most importantly, the ability to make ethical judgments given the interplay between competing values and their grounding in different contexts (e.g., the right to freedom of expression vs. preventing the spread of fake news). Our paper begins to address these questions within the deep learning paradigm. Our prototype model, Delphi, demonstrates strong promise of language-based commonsense moral reasoning, with up to 92.1\% accuracy vetted by humans. This is in stark contrast to the zero-shot performance of GPT-3 of 52.3\%, which suggests that massive scale alone does not endow pre-trained neural language models with human values. Thus, we present Commonsense Norm Bank, a moral textbook customized for machines, which compiles 1.7M examples of people's ethical judgments on a broad spectrum of everyday situations. In addition to the new resources and baseline performances for future research, our study provides new insights that lead to several important open research questions: differentiating between universal human values and personal values, modeling different moral frameworks, and explainable, consistent approaches to machine ethics.},

We used six different qPCR instruments, we performed 1–16 qPCR replicates per concentration and we tested 2–10 μl volume of analyte transferred, respectively.

These key genes can act as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive markers of disease. Gene expression ‘signatures’ in the blood hold the potential to be used for the diagnosis of infectious diseases, where current diagnostics are unreliable, ineffective or of limited potential. For diagnostic tests based on RNA signatures to be useful clinically, the first step is to identify the minimum set of gene transcripts that accurately identify the disease in question. The second requirement is rapid and cost-effective detection of the gene expression levels. Signatures have been described for a number of infectious diseases, but ‘clinic-ready’ technologies for RNA detection from clinical samples are limited, though existing methods such as RT-PCR are likely to be superseded by a number of emerging technologies, which may form the basis of the translation of gene expression signatures into routine diagnostic tests for a range of disease states.},

	abstract = {Background Model-based analysis of data from quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is potentially more powerful and versatile than traditional methods. Yet existing model-based approaches cannot properly deal with the higher sampling variances associated with low-abundant targets, nor do they provide a natural way to incorporate assumptions about the stability of control genes directly into the model-fitting process. Results In our method, raw qPCR data are represented as molecule counts, and described using generalized linear mixed models under Poisson-lognormal error. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to sample from the joint posterior distribution over all model parameters, thereby estimating the effects of all experimental factors on the expression of every gene. The Poisson-based model allows for the correct specification of the mean-variance relationship of the PCR amplification process, and can also glean information from instances of no amplification (zero counts). Our method is very flexible with respect to control genes: any prior knowledge about the expected degree of their stability can be directly incorporated into the model. Yet the method provides sensible answers without such assumptions, or even in the complete absence of control genes. We also present a natural Bayesian analogue of the “classic” analysis, which uses standard data pre-processing steps (logarithmic transformation and multi-gene normalization) but estimates all gene expression changes jointly within a single model. The new methods are considerably more flexible and powerful than the standard delta-delta Ct analysis based on pairwise t-tests. Conclusions Our methodology expands the applicability of the relative-quantification analysis protocol all the way to the lowest-abundance targets, and provides a novel opportunity to analyze qRT-PCR data without making any assumptions concerning target stability. These procedures have been implemented as the MCMC.qpcr package in R.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to compare different nonlinear functions to describe the growth curve of European quails and to estimate growth curve parameters, (co)variance components, and genetic and systematic effects that affected the curve using a hierarchical Bayesian model that allows joint estimation. Three different models were fitted in the first stage (Gompertz, Logístic, and von Bertalanffy). The analyzed data set had 45,965 records of 6,838 meat quails selected for higher body weight at 42 d of age for 15 successive generations, weighed at birth, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 d of age. Comparisons of the overall goodness of fit were based on deviance information criterion (DIC) and mean square error. Gelfand's check function compared the models at different points of the growth curve. In the second stage, the systematic (sex and generation) and genetic effects were considered in an animal model. Random samples of the a posteriori distributions were obtained by Metropolis–Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms. The Gompertz function presented lower DIC and better adjustment at different ages and was defined as the best fit. The heritabilities of A, b, and k parameters were moderate (0.32, 0.29, and 0.18, respectively). The genetics correlations were A and b (0.25), A and k (–0.50), and b and k (0.03). The samples of the posterior marginal distributions for the differences between the estimates of the parameters of the Gompertz model, for generation, A, b, k, age at inflexion point (APOI), and weight at inflexion point (WPOI) showed differences in relation to sex, the females are heavier, A, WPOI, and APOI for females were also higher. In conclusion, 15 generations of selection and changes in the environmental conditions altered the growth curve, leaving the quails heavier and with greater WPOI and APOI, decreased growth rate, and increased the birth weight. The curve parameters could be used in a selection index, despite the difficulty in selecting quails with higher rate of growth and adult body weight.},

	abstract = {Tumor growth curves are classically modeled by means of ordinary differential equations. In analyzing the Gompertz model several studies have reported a striking correlation between the two parameters of the model, which could be used to reduce the dimensionality and improve predictive power. We analyzed tumor growth kinetics within the statistical framework of nonlinear mixed-effects (population approach). This allowed the simultaneous modeling of tumor dynamics and inter-animal variability. Experimental data comprised three animal models of breast and lung cancers, with 833 measurements in 94 animals. Candidate models of tumor growth included the exponential, logistic and Gompertz models. The exponential and—more notably—logistic models failed to describe the experimental data whereas the Gompertz model generated very good fits. The previously reported population-level correlation between the Gompertz parameters was further confirmed in our analysis (R2 {\textgreater} 0.92 in all groups). Combining this structural correlation with rigorous population parameter estimation, we propose a reduced Gompertz function consisting of a single individual parameter (and one population parameter). Leveraging the population approach using Bayesian inference, we estimated times of tumor initiation using three late measurement timepoints. The reduced Gompertz model was found to exhibit the best results, with drastic improvements when using Bayesian inference as compared to likelihood maximization alone, for both accuracy and precision. Specifically, mean accuracy (prediction error) was 12.2\% versus 78\% and mean precision (width of the 95\% prediction interval) was 15.6 days versus 210 days, for the breast cancer cell line. These results demonstrate the superior predictive power of the reduced Gompertz model, especially when combined with Bayesian estimation. They offer possible clinical perspectives for personalized prediction of the age of a tumor from limited data at diagnosis.

	abstract = {Objectives In paleodemography, the Bayesian approach has been suggested to provide an effective means by which mortality profiles of past populations can be adequately estimated, and thus avoid problems of “age-mimicry” inherent in conventional approaches. In this study, we propose an application of the Gompertz model using an “informative” prior probability distribution by revising a recent example of the Bayesian approach based on an “uninformative” distribution. Methods Life-table data of 134 human populations including those of contemporary hunter-gatherers were used to determine the Gompertz parameters of each population. In each population, we used both raw life-table data and the Gompertz parameters to calculate some demographic values such as the mean life-span, to confirm representativeness of the model. Then, the correlation between the two Gompertz parameters (the Strehler–Mildvan correlation) was re-established. We incorporated the correlation into the Bayesian approach as an “informative” prior probability distribution, and tested its effectiveness using simulated data. Results Our analyses showed that the mean life-span (≥ age 15) and the proportion of living persons aging over 45 were well-reproduced by the Gompertz model. The simulation showed that using the correlation as an informative prior provides a narrower estimation range in the Bayesian approach than does the uninformative prior. Conclusions The Gompertz model can be assumed to accurately estimate the mean life-span and/or the proportion of old people in a population. We suggest that the Strehler–Mildvan correlation can be used as a useful constraint in demographic reconstructions of past human populations.

Among them, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has several advantages, including its higher tolerance to the presence of inhibitors and the possibility of naked-eye detection, which enables and simplifies its potential use in decentralized settings. In the current study, a real-time LAMP (qLAMP) method for the detection of Dreissena polymorpha was developed and tested with samples from the Guadalquivir River basin, together with two real-time PCR (qPCR) methods using different detection chemistries, targeting a specific region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I. All three developed approaches were evaluated regarding specificity, sensitivity and time required for detection. Regarding sensitivity, both qPCR approaches were more sensitive than qLAMP by one order of magnitude, however the qLAMP method proved to be as specific and much faster being performed in just 9 min versus 23 and 29 min for the qPCR methods based on hydrolysis probe and intercalating dye respectively.},

It has been frequently used to describe the growth of animals and plants, as well as the number or volume of bacteria and cancer cells. Numerous parametrisations and re-parametrisations of varying usefulness are found in the literature, whereof the Gompertz-Laird is one of the more commonly used. Here, we review, present, and discuss the many re-parametrisations and some parameterisations of the Gompertz model, which we divide into Ti (type I)- and W0 (type II)-forms. In the W0-form a starting-point parameter, meaning birth or hatching value (W0), replaces the inflection-time parameter (Ti). We also propose new “unified” versions (U-versions) of both the traditional Ti -form and a simplified W0-form. In these, the growth-rate constant represents the relative growth rate instead of merely an unspecified growth coefficient. We also present U-versions where the growth-rate parameters return absolute growth rate (instead of relative). The new U-Gompertz models are special cases of the Unified-Richards (U-Richards) model and thus belong to the Richards family of U-models. As U-models, they have a set of parameters, which are comparable across models in the family, without conversion equations. The improvements are simple, and may seem trivial, but are of great importance to those who study organismal growth, as the two new U-Gompertz forms give easy and fast access to all shape parameters needed for describing most types of growth following the shape of the Gompertz model.},

	abstract = {Genetic instability is an important characteristic of cancer. While most cancers develop genetic instability at some stage of their progression, sometimes a temporary rise of instability is followed by the return to a relatively stable genome. Neither the reasons for these dynamics, nor, more generally, the role of instability in tumor progression, are well understood. In this paper we develop a class of mathematical models to study the evolutionary competition dynamics among different sub-populations in a heterogeneous tumor. We observe that despite the complexity of this multi-component and multi-process system, there is only a small number of scenarios expected in the context of the evolution of instability. If the penalty incurred by unstable cells (the decrease in the growth due to deleterious mutations) is high compared with the gain (the production rate of advantageous mutations), then instability does not evolve. In the opposite case, instability evolves and comes to dominate the system. In the intermediate parameter regime, instability is generated but later gives way to stable clones. Moreover, the model also informs us of the patterns of instability for cancer lineages corresponding to different stages of progression. It is predicted that mutations causing instability are merely “passengers” in tumors that have undergone only a small number of malignant mutations. Further down the path of carcinogenesis, however, unstable cells are more likely to give rise to the winning clonal wave that takes over the tumor and carries the evolution forward, thus conferring a causal role of the instability in such cases. Further, each individual clonal wave (i.e. cells harboring a fixed number of malignant driver mutations) experiences its own evolutionary history. It can fall under one of three types of temporal behavior: stable throughout, unstable to stable, or unstable throughout. Which scenario is realized depends on the subtle (but predictable) interplay among mutation rates and the death toll associated with the instability. The modeling approach provided here sheds light onto important aspects of the evolutionary dynamics of instability, which may be relevant to treatment scenarios that target instability or damage repair.},

Insight into the possible mechanisms leading to genomic instability can be gained by reviewing the recent high-throughput sequencing studies of human cancers.In hereditary cancers, characterized either by microsatellite instability or chromosomal instability, the underlying basis for the genomic instability is mutations in DNA repair genes.In sporadic (non-hereditary) cancers, genomic instability, at least at the early stages of cancer development, is not due to mutations in DNA repair genes or mitotic checkpoint genes.The pattern of mutations in sporadic human cancers suggests that the selective pressure for tumour suppressor p53 (TP53) mutations is linked to DNA damage, rather than p14ARF activation.Genomic instability in sporadic human cancers may be linked to oncogene-induced DNA damage.Analysis of the recent high-throughput sequencing studies of human cancers suggests that genomic instability can be added to the original hallmarks of cancer, and that two previously distinct hallmarks, self-sufficiency in growth signals and insensitivity to anti-growth signals, can be consolidated into one.},

In response to this issue, we come up with a mathematical model incorporating effects of genomic instability to investigate the genomic instability pathway of human lung cancer. The presented model are applied to match the incidence rate data of lung cancer from the Life Span Study cohort of the atomic bomb survivors in Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry in the United States. Model results suggest that genomic instability is necessary in the tumorigenesis of lung cancer, and genomic instability has no significant impact on the net proliferation rate of cells by statistical criteria. By comparing the results of the LSS data to those of the SEER data, we conclude that the genomic instability pathway exhibits a sensitivity to radiation exposure, more intensive in male patients.},

Here we present SparseSignatures, a novel framework to extract signatures from somatic point mutation data. Our approach incorporates a user-specified background signature, employs regularization to reduce noise in non-background signatures, uses cross-validation to identify the number of signatures, and is scalable to large datasets. We show that SparseSignatures outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on simulated data using a variety of standard metrics. We then apply SparseSignatures to whole genome sequences of pancreatic and breast tumors, discovering well-differentiated signatures that are linked to known mutagenic mechanisms and are strongly associated with patient clinical features.},

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},

	abstract = {Nowadays an increasing amount of data is available and we have to deal with models in high dimension (number of covariates much larger than the sample size). Under sparsity assumption it is reasonable to hope that we can make a good estimation of the regression parameter. This sparsity assumption as well as a block structuration of the covariates into groups with similar modes of behavior is for example quite natural in genomics. A huge amount of scientific literature exists for Gaussian linear models including the Lasso estimator and also the Group Lasso estimator which promotes group sparsity under an a priori knowledge of the groups. We extend this Group Lasso procedure to generalized linear models and we study the properties of this estimator for sparse high-dimensional generalized linear models to find convergence rates. We provide oracle inequalities for the prediction and estimation error under assumptions on the covariables and under a condition on the design matrix. We show the ability of this estimator to recover good sparse approximation of the true model. At last we extend these results to the case of an Elastic net penalty and we apply them to the so-called Poisson regression case which has not been studied in this context contrary to the logistic regression.},

While these problems are generally dealt with separately, we present a simple regularized formulation allowing to solve all three of them in parallel, using standard optimization routines. Specifically, we extend the group Lasso penalty (originated in the linear regression literature) in order to impose group-level sparsity on the network's connections, where each group is defined as the set of outgoing weights from a unit. Depending on the specific case, the weights can be related to an input variable, to a hidden neuron, or to a bias unit, thus performing simultaneously all the aforementioned tasks in order to obtain a compact network. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation, by comparing with classical weight decay and Lasso penalties. We show that a sparse version of the group Lasso penalty is able to achieve competitive performances, while at the same time resulting in extremely compact networks with a smaller number of input features. We evaluate both on a toy dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and on multiple realistic large-scale classification problems.},

Liquid biopsy analysis of circulating cell-free DNA fragments in the patients’ blood can monitor clonality and evolving mutations as a surrogate for tumour biopsy. Next generation sequencing platforms and digital droplet PCR can be used to profile circulating tumour DNA from liquid biopsies; however, they are expensive and time consuming for clinical use. Here, we report a novel strategy with proof-of-concept data that supports the usage of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect PIK3CA c.3140 A {\textgreater} G (H1047R), a prevalent BC missense mutation that is attributed to BC tumour growth. Allele-specific primers were designed and optimized to detect the p.H1047R variant following the USS-sbLAMP method. The assay was developed with synthetic DNA templates and validated with DNA from two breast cancer cell-lines and two patient tumour tissue samples through a qPCR instrument and finally piloted on an ISFET enabled microchip. This work sets a foundation for BC mutational profiling on a Lab-on-Chip device, to help the early detection of patient relapse and to monitor efficacy of systemic therapies for personalised cancer patient management.},

The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay strategy was demonstrated by using optimized real-time fluorescence measurements in a single tube at a constant temperature of 62 °C for 30–60 min. The survivin gene was the target sequence amplified by LAMP. By testing serial tenfold dilutions of target DNA ranging from 1 × 106 copies to 1 copy per tube, the developed method showed that the detection limit (analytical sensitivity) for the survivin gene was 10 copies per tube. Our assay strategy is able to offer high amplification efficiency, excellent reproducibility, and cost-effective and simplified operations. Without the requirements for sophisticated equipment and technical skills of the PCR, the LAMP method can add a great deal of value to small-scale hospitals, point-of-care testing, and clinical laboratories.},

Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified. Overall, the present study shows that the LAMP method may serve as a valuable alternative for the identification oncogene mutations.},

	abstract = {In domestic animals of the family Bovidae, sex preselection of offspring has been demanded for convenience of milk/beef production and animal breeding. Development of the nonsurgical embryo transfer technique and sexing methods of preimplantation embryos made it possible. Sexing based on detection of Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences is considered the most reliable method to date. PCR enables amplification of a target sequence from a small number of blastomeres. However, it requires technical skill and is time consuming. Furthermore, PCR has the risk of false positives because of DNA contamination during handling of the PCR products in duplicate PCR procedures and/or electrophoresis. Therefore, for embryo sexing to become widely used in the cattle embryo transfer industry, a simple, rapid and precise sexing method needs to be developed. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel DNA amplification method, and the reaction is carried out under isothermal conditions (range, 60 to 65 C) using DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. When the target DNA is amplified by LAMP, a white precipitate derived from magnesium pyrophosphate (a by-product of the LAMP reaction) is observed. It is noteworthy that LAMP does not need special reagents or electrophoresis to detect the amplified DNA. This review describes the development and application of an embryo sexing method using LAMP in cattle and water buffaloes.},

	abstract = {PCR is a universal tool for the multiplication of specific DNA sequences. For example, PCR-based sex determination is widely used, and a diversity of primer sets is available. However, this protocol requires thermal cycling and electrophoresis, so results are typically obtained in laboratories and several days after sampling. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is an alternative to PCR that can take molecular ecology outside the laboratory. Although its application has been successfully probed for sex determination in three species of a single avian Family (raptors, Accipitridae), its generality remains untested and suitable primers across taxa are lacking. We designed and tested the first LAMP-based primer set for sex determination across the modern birds (NEO-W) based on a fragment of the gene chromo-helicase-DNA-binding protein located on the female-specific W chromosome. As nucleotide identity is expected to increase among more related taxa, taxonomically targeted primers were also developed for the Order Falconiformes and Families Psittacidae, Ciconiidae, Estrildidae and Icteridae as examples. NEO-W successfully determined sex in a subset of 21 species within 17 Families and 10 Orders and is therefore a candidate primer for all modern birds. Primer sets designed specifically for the selected taxa correctly assigned sex to the evaluated species. A short troubleshooting guide for new LAMP users is provided to identify false negatives and optimize LAMP reactions.

The aim of this study was to identify the SRY gene for embryo sex determination in human during pregnancy using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method.
METHODS: A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected, and Plasma DNA was extracted. LAMP assay was performed using DNA obtained for detection of SRY gene. Furthermore, colorimetric LAMP assay for rapid and easy detection of SRY gene was developed.
RESULTS: LAMP results revealed that the positive reaction was highly specific only with samples containing XY chromosomes, while no amplification was found in samples containing XX chromosomes. A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women were seven male embryos (46.6\%) and eight female embryos (53.4\%). All used visual components in the colorimetric assay could successfully make a clear distinction between positive and negative ones.

Materials and Methods: A set of six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences of the target. The whole process can be completed in 1 h under isothermal conditions at 63°C. Detection and quantification can be achieved by real-time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter based on threshold time required for turbidity in the LAMP reaction. A standard curve was constructed by plotting viral titre against the threshold time (Tt) using plasmid standards with high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0·988). Conclusions: Sensitivity analysis using 10-fold dilutions (equivalent to 35 ng μl−1 to 35 ag μl−1) of plasmid standards revealed this method is capable of detecting upto 100 copies of template DNA. Cross-reactivity analysis with DNA/cDNA of IHHNV, TSV, YHV-infected and healthy shrimp showed this method is highly specific for quantitative detection of WSSV.

A quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) assay using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probe was assessed by grape growers in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Custom impaction spore samplers were placed at a research vineyard and six commercial vineyard locations, and were tested bi-weekly by the lab and by growers. Grower-conducted qLAMP assays used a beta-version of the Smart-DART handheld LAMP reaction devices (Diagenetix, Inc., Honolulu, HI, USA), connected to Android 4.4 enabled, Bluetooth-capable Nexus 7 tablets for output. Quantification by a quantitative PCR assay was assumed correct to compare the lab and grower qLAMP assay quantification. Growers were able to conduct and interpret qLAMP results; however, the Erysiphe necator inoculum quantification was unreliable using the beta-Smart-DART devices. The qLAMP assay developed was sensitive to one spore in early testing of the assay, but decreased to {\textgreater}20 spores by the end of the trial. The qLAMP assay is not likely a suitable management tool for grape powdery mildew due to losses in sensitivity and decreasing costs and portability for other, more reliable molecular tools.},

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is well known for its robust and highly sensitive and specific amplification of target DNA, which is achieved by utilizing up to six primers. Moreover, LAMP excels through its isothermal and energy efficient amplification requirements, rendering it a prime candidate for low-cost diagnostics and analysis at the point of need. Recently, methods for sequence-specific detection have gained more importance because, unlike sequence-independent detection methods, they are highly specific towards the target DNA. In the last 13 years, a variety of sequence-specific methods have emerged, based on a very diverse range of sensing techniques, including optical, magnetic, piezoelectric, electrochemical and magnetoresistive sensing. To give structure to the diverse multitude of sequence-specific methods, we created a systematic classification and provide a critical comparative evaluation according to a catalogue of criteria (analytical performance, multiplexing, quantification and instrumental requirements). Fluorescence-based detection, making up half of the methods, can be processed on open platforms and satisfies all the criteria listed before. Instrumental requirements are discussed in terms of complexity, portability and fluidic cartridges. In addition, the technological readiness level and the kind of platform (open versus method-tailored) are evaluated, the latter playing an important role in the miniaturization and automation of operational process steps. We also observe an increase in the use of smartphone-integrated sensors to improve LAMP-based point-of-need testing. In summary, recent developments in methods for the sequence-specific detection of LAMP demonstrate high potential for many future applications.},

	abstract = {Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is one of the most popular isothermal DNA amplification techniques for research and commercial applications, enabling amplification of both DNA and RNA (with the assistance of reverse transcriptase). The LAMP mechanism is powered by strategic primer design and a strand displacement polymerase, generating products that fold over, creating loops. LAMP leads to generation of products of increasing length over time. These products containing multiple loops are conventionally called cauliflower structures. Existing literature on LAMP provides extremely limited understanding of progression of cascades of reactions involved in the reaction and it is believed that cauliflower structures of increasing length constitute a majority of the product formed in LAMP. This study presents a first of its kind stoichiometric and pseudo kinetic model to comprehend LAMP reactions in deeper depth by (i) classifying LAMP reaction products into uniquely identifiable categories, (ii) generating a condensed reaction network to depict millions of interconnected reactions occurring during LAMP, and (iii) elucidating the pathways for amplicon generation. Despite the inherent limitations of conventional stoichiometric modelling for polymerization type reactions (the network rapidly becomes too large and intractable), our model provides new theoretical understanding of the LAMP reaction pathway. The model shows that while longer length products are formed, it is the smaller length recycle amplicons that contribute more towards the exponential increase in the amount of double stranded DNA. Prediction of concentration of different types of LAMP amplicons will also contribute substantially towards informing design of probe-based assays.},

Here, we describe a methodology for colorimetric quantitative analysis of nucleic acid using an easy-to-build smartphone-based platform, offering low-cost, portability, simplicity in operation, and user-friendliness. The whole system consists of a hand-held box equipped with a smartphone, a film heater, a white LED, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) chip, and a DC converter, and all the processes were powered by a portable battery of 5 V. Upon the amplification of the target gene by an Eriochrome Black T-mediated LAMP reaction, the color of the LAMP reaction was changed from violet to blue that was real-time recorded by a smartphone camera. To keep track of the progress of the color change, we developed a novel mobile app in which a hue value was accepted as an indicator for color transition and for determining the threshold time of the amplification reaction. A calibration curve could be generated by plotting the logarithm of the known concentration of the DNA templates versus the threshold time, and it can be used to predict the copy number of nucleic acids in the test samples. Thus, the proposed mobile platform can inform us of not only qualitative but also quantitative results of the pathogens. We believe that this advanced colorimetric approach and the mobile app can expand the potentials of the smartphone for the future POCT system in the bio-diagnostic fields.},

LAMP demonstrates performance equivalent to that of PCR, but its application has been limited by the challenging primer design. The design of six primers in LAMP requires a selection of eight priming sites with significant restrictions imposed on their respective positioning and orientation. In order to relieve primer design constraints we propose an alternative approach which uses Stem primers instead of Loop primers and demonstrate the application of STEM-LAMP in assaying for Clostridium difficile, Listeria monocytogenes and HIV. Stem primers used in LAMP in combination with loop-generating and displacement primers gave significant benefits in speed and sensitivity, similar to those offered by Loop primers, while offering additional options of forward and reverse orientations, multiplexing, use in conjunction with Loop primers or even omission of one or two displacement primers, where necessary. Stem primers represent a valuable alternative to Loop primers and an additional tool for IVD assay development by offering more choices for primer design at the same time increasing assay speed, sensitivity, and reproducibility.},

The framework enables rational and automatic design of primers for optimal targeting of one or more sequences in ensembles of nearly identical DNA templates. In situations where optimal targeting is not feasible, the framework accurately predicts non-target sequences that are difficult to distinguish with PCR alone. Based on the synergistic effects of disparate sources of PCR bias, we used our framework to robustly distinguish between two alleles that differ by a single base pair. To demonstrate the applicability to environmental microbiology, we designed primers specific to all recognized archaeal and bacterial genera in the Ribosomal Database Project, and have made these primers available online. We applied these primers experimentally to obtain genus-specific amplification of 16S rRNA genes representing minor constituents of an environmental DNA sample. Our results demonstrate that inherent PCR biases can be reliably employed in an automatic fashion to maximize sequence discrimination and accurately identify potential cross-amplifications. We have made our framework accessible online as a programme for designing primers targeting one group of sequences in a set with many other sequences (http://DECIPHER.cee.wisc.edu).},

	abstract = {Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a highly efficient, selective and rapid DNA amplification technique for genetic screening of pathogens. However, despite its popularity, there is yet no mathematical model to quantify the outcome and no well-defined metric for comparing results that are available. LAMP is intrinsically complex and involves multiple pathways for gene replication, making fundamental modelling nearly intractable. To circumvent this difficulty, an alternate, empirical model is introduced that will allow one to extract a set of parameters from the concentration versus time curves. A simple recipe to deduce the time to positive, Tp - a parameter analogous to the threshold cycling time in polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is also provided. These parameters can be regarded as objective and unambiguous indicators of LAMP amplification. The model is exemplified on Escherichia coli strains by using the two gene fragments responsible for vero-toxin (VT) production and tested against VT-producing (O157 and O45) and non-VT producing (DH5 alpha) strains. Selective amplification of appropriate target sequences was made using well established LAMP primers and protocols, and the concentrations of the amplicons were measured using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer at specific intervals of time. The data is fitted to a generalized logistic function. Apart from providing precise screening indicators, representing the data with a small set of numbers offers significant advantages. It facilitates comparisons of LAMP reactions independently of the sampling technique. It also eliminates subjectivity in interpretation, simplifies data analysis, and allows easy data archival, retrieval and statistical analysis for large sample populations. To our knowledge this work represents a first attempt to quantitatively model LAMP and offer a standard method that could pave the way towards high throughput automated screening.},

Here, we generated a novel Taq PCR data set that reports the amplification status for pairs of primers and templates from a reference set of 47 immunoglobulin heavy chain variable sequences and 20 primers. Using logistic regression, we developed TMM, a model for predicting whether a primer amplifies a template given their nucleotide sequences. The model suggests that the free energy of annealing, ΔG, is the key driver of amplification (p = 7.35e-12) and that 3′ mismatches should be considered in dependence on ΔG and the mismatch closest to the 3′ terminus (p = 1.67e-05). We validated TMM by comparing its estimates with those from the thermodynamic model of DECIPHER (DE) and a model based solely on the free energy of annealing (FE). TMM outperformed the other approaches in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (TMM: 0.953, FE: 0.941, DE: 0.896). TMM can improve primer design and is freely available via openPrimeR (http://openPrimeR.mpi-inf.mpg.de).},

	abstract = {Tumor heterogeneity may reduce the efficacy of molecularly guided systemic therapy for cancers that have metastasized. To determine whether the genomic alterations in a single metastasis provide a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic drivers of other dispersed metastases in an individual, we analyzed multiple tumors from men with disseminated prostate cancer through whole-exome sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and RNA transcript profiling, and we compared the genomic diversity within and between individuals. In contrast to the substantial heterogeneity between men, there was limited diversity among metastases within an individual. The number of somatic mutations, the burden of genomic copy number alterations and aberrations in known oncogenic drivers were all highly concordant, as were metrics of androgen receptor (AR) activity and cell cycle activity. AR activity was inversely associated with cell proliferation, whereas the expression of Fanconi anemia (FA)-complex genes was correlated with elevated cell cycle progression, expression of the E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and loss of retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Men with somatic aberrations in FA-complex genes or in ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) exhibited significantly longer treatment-response durations to carboplatin than did men without defects in genes encoding DNA-repair proteins. Collectively, these data indicate that although exceptions exist, evaluating a single metastasis provides a reasonable assessment of the major oncogenic driver alterations that are present in disseminated tumors within an individual, and thus may be useful for selecting treatments on the basis of predicted molecular vulnerabilities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence highlight the urgent need to identify genomic abnormalities in prostate tumors in different ethnic populations including Asian men.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically explore the genomic complexity and define disease-driven genetic alterations in PCa.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study sequenced whole-genome and transcriptome of tumor-benign paired tissues from 65 treatment-naive Chinese PCa patients. Subsequent targeted deep sequencing of 293 PCa-relevant genes was performed in another cohort of 145 prostate tumors.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The genomic alteration landscape in PCa was analyzed using an integrated computational pipeline. Relationships with PCa progression and survival were analyzed using nonparametric test, log-rank, and multivariable Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We demonstrated an association of high frequency of CHD1 deletion with a low rate of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and relatively high percentage of mutations in androgen receptor upstream activator genes in Chinese patients. We identified five putative clustered deleted tumor suppressor genes and provided experimental and clinical evidence that PCDH9, deleted/loss in approximately 23\% of tumors, functions as a novel tumor suppressor gene with prognostic potential in PCa. Furthermore, axon guidance pathway genes were frequently deregulated, including gain/amplification of PLXNA1 gene in approximately 17\% of tumors. Functional and clinical data analyses showed that increased expression of PLXNA1 promoted prostate tumor growth and independently predicted prostate tumor biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and poor survival in multi-institutional cohorts of patients with PCa. A limitation of this study is that other genetic alterations were not experimentally investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: There are shared and salient genetic characteristics of PCa in Chinese and Caucasian men. Novel genetic alterations in PCDH9 and PLXNA1 were associated with disease progression.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We reported the first large-scale and comprehensive genomic data of prostate cancer from Asian population. Identification of these genetic alterations may help advance prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.},

We identify and validate a new class of E26 transformation-specific (ETS)-fusion-negative tumors defined by mutations in epigenetic regulators, as well as alterations in pathways not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the spliceosome pathway. We find that the incidence of significantly mutated genes (SMGs) follows a long-tail distribution, with many genes mutated in less than 3\% of cases. We identify a total of 97 SMGs, including 70 not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the ubiquitin ligase CUL3 and the transcription factor SPEN. Finally, comparing primary and metastatic prostate cancer identifies a set of genomic markers that may inform risk stratification.},

SMC harbors higher proportions of HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes, lower proportion of Luminal A with decreased ESR1 expression compared to TCGA. We also observe increased mutation prevalence affecting BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 in SMC with an enrichment of a mutation signature linked to homologous recombination repair deficiency in TNBC. Finally, virtual microdissection and multivariate analyses reveal that Korean BC status is independently associated with increased TIL and decreased TGF-β signaling expression signatures, suggesting that younger Asian BCs harbor more immune-active microenvironment than western BCs.},

Therapeutic approaches for treating cancers with such mutations have focused on targeting the downstream protein effectors of KRAS. However, to date, no approved treatment has targeted the mutated KRAS oncogene directly. Presently, we used the selectivity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly target mutated KRAS alleles. We designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target two specific single-nucleotide missense mutations on KRAS codon-12 located in the seed region adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Lentiviral transduction of Cas9 and the sgRNAs into cancer cells with respective KRAS mutations resulted in high frequency of indels in the seed region. Indel-associated disruption of the mutant KRAS alleles correlated with reduced viability of the cancer cells. The results indicate that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing can potentially be used for the treatment of cancer patients, specifically those with oncogenic KRAS mutations.},

Barcoded libraries from patient-matched tumor and normal samples were captured, sequenced, and subjected to a custom analysis pipeline to identify somatic mutations. Sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility of MSK-IMPACT were assessed through extensive analytical validation. We tested 284 tumor samples with previously known point mutations and insertions/deletions in 47 exons of 19 cancer genes. All known variants were accurately detected, and there was high reproducibility of inter- and intrarun replicates. The detection limit for low-frequency variants was approximately 2\% for hotspot mutations and 5\% for nonhotspot mutations. Copy number alterations and structural rearrangements were also reliably detected. MSK-IMPACT profiles oncogenic DNA alterations in clinical solid tumor samples with high accuracy and sensitivity.

	abstract = {Background: Several studies have demonstrated the potential clinical utility of TMB as a biomarker of immune checkpoint blockade in multiple tumor types, including lung cancer. Prior analyses have been retrospective and exploratory, with varying cutoffs and methodologies used to assess TMB. The establishment of a clinically validated cutoff for nivo + ipi is required to confirm the clinical utility of TMB as a predictive biomarker in future studies. CheckMate 568 (NCT02659059) is a large, single-arm, phase 2 study of nivo + ipi in 1L NSCLC. TMB was assessed using Foundation One CDx™ (Foundation Medicine, Inc.) to identify an appropriate TMB cutoff to select patients for 1L nivo + ipi therapy. This cutoff was subsequently validated through a preplanned analysis in CheckMate 227, which evaluated progression-free survival in patients with high TMB as a co-primary endpoint (NCT02477826).
Methods: In CheckMate 568, 288 patients with chemotherapy-naive stage IV NSCLC received nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipi 1 mg/kg Q6W for up to 2 years. EGFR- and ALK-targetable NSCLC were excluded. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as per independent review. ORR by TMB was a secondary endpoint. TMB was assessed using the validated FoundationOne® CDx assay (Foundation Medicine, Inc.). TMB classification performance with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to determine an appropriate TMB cutoff associated with enhanced efficacy of nivo + ipi in 1L NSCLC. Prevalence analyses of TMB and PD-L1 were also conducted.
Results: Baseline characteristics and efficacy were similar in both the all treated and TMB-evaluable populations. With a minimum follow-up of 3 months, ORR was 27\% in all treated patients. ORR increased in patients with higher TMB, and plateaued with the threshold of ≥10 mutations (mut)/Mb (ORR: 4\%, 10\%, 44\%, and 39\% in patients with TMB {\textless}5, {\textless}10, ≥10, and ≥15 mut/Mb, respectively). ROC analysis of TMB vs ORR for nivo + ipi demonstrated optimal classification performance at 10 mut/Mb. The safety profile for nivo + ipi was consistent with previous reports and no new safety signals were observed.
Conclusions: TMB ≥10 mut/Mb was associated with enhanced response to nivo + ipi regardless of PD-L1 expression, with ORRs {\textgreater}40\%. This response rate, coupled with the known durability of responses to immuno-oncology agents, compares favorably to historical data with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Therefore, a cutoff of ≥10 mut/Mb was chosen to define the TMB patient population for the co-primary efficacy endpoint in CheckMate 227.

In this part of an open-label, multipart, phase 3 trial, we examined progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy among patients with a high tumor mutational burden (≥10 mutations per megabase).
METHODS: We enrolled patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was not previously treated with chemotherapy. Those with a level of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of at least 1\% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab monotherapy, or chemotherapy; those with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of less than 1\% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. Tumor mutational burden was determined by the FoundationOne CDx assay.
RESULTS: Progression-free survival among patients with a high tumor mutational burden was significantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 42.6\% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2\% with chemotherapy, and the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 13.2) versus 5.5 months (95\% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 97.5\% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P{\textless}0.001). The objective response rate was 45.3\% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 26.9\% with chemotherapy. The benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over chemotherapy was broadly consistent within subgroups, including patients with a PD-L1 expression level of at least 1\% and those with a level of less than 1\%. The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events was 31.2\% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.1\% with chemotherapy. ical; CheckMate 227 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02477826 .).
CONCLUSIONS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy among patients with NSCLC and a high tumor mutational burden, irrespective of PD-L1 expression level. The results validate the benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in NSCLC and the role of tumor mutational burden as a biomarker for patient selection.

	abstract = {Clinical evidence demonstrates that treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy agents can have considerable benefit across multiple tumours. However, there is a need for the development of predictive biomarkers that identify patients who are most likely to respond to immunotherapy. Comprehensive characterisation of tumours using genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches continues to lead the way in advancing precision medicine. Genetic correlates of response to therapy have been known for some time, but recent clinical evidence has strengthened the significance of high tumour mutational burden (TMB) as a biomarker of response and hence a rational target for immunotherapy. Concordantly, immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed clinical practice for lung cancer and melanoma, which are tumour types with some of the highest mutational burdens. TMB is an implementable approach for molecular biology and/or pathology laboratories that provides a quantitative measure of the total number of mutations in tumour tissue of patients and can be assessed by whole genome, whole exome, or large targeted gene panel sequencing of biopsied material. Currently, TMB assessment is not standardised across research and clinical studies. As a biomarker that affects treatment decisions, it is essential to unify TMB assessment approaches to allow for reliable, comparable results across studies. When implementing TMB measurement assays, it is important to consider factors that may impact the method workflow, the results of the assay, and the interpretation of the data. Such factors include biopsy sample type, sample quality and quantity, genome coverage, sequencing platform, bioinformatic pipeline, and the definitions of the final threshold that determines high TMB. This review outlines the factors for adoption of TMB measurement into clinical practice, providing an understanding of TMB assay considerations throughout the sample journey, and suggests principles to effectively implement TMB assays in a clinical setting to aid and optimise treatment decisions.},

Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the gold standard to derive the TMB; while targeted next-generation sequencing panels might be more feasible. However, mainstream panels use 'correlation' (R2) between panel- and WES-based TMB to validate TMB estimation, which could be vulnerable to be distorted by cases with relatively ultra-high TMB within each cancer type. The FDA-approved FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) panel-based TMB estimation seemed reliable (R2 ≥ 0.75) in 24 out of 33 cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas, but most of them were overestimated by correlation as only seven cancer types had satisfactory accuracy (the proportion of cases correctly identified as TMB-high or TMB-low using panel-based TMB) above 90\%. After removing cases with relatively ultra-high TMB within each cancer type, the correlation (R2) in 16 of these 24 cancer types declined dramatically (Δ {\textgreater} 0.25) while all of their accuracy remained generally constant, indicating that accuracy is more robust than correlation. Similar results were also observed in other four panels. Further incorporating accuracy in panel design revealed that the minimal number of genes needed to achieve ≥ 90\% accuracy varied among cancer types and correlated negatively with their TMB levels (p = 0.001). In summary, currently available panels can accurately assess TMB only in several particular cancer types; and accuracy outperformed correlation in assessing the performance of panel-based TMB estimation. Accuracy and cancer type individualization should be incorporated in designing panels for TMB estimation.},

And given to the differences in the mutational landscapes among different types of cancer, we aimed to develop a cancer-specific signature to estimate TMB for right-sided colon cancer patients (RCC). Using WES data of 315 RCC patients, we identified the exons in which the number of mutational sites of the coding DNA sequences associated with TMB through linear regression analysis. Then, among these exons, we extracted a signature composed by 102 exons ({\textasciitilde}0.13 Mbp) through a heuristic selection procedure. The TMB estimated by the signature was highly correlated with those calculated by WES in the discovery dataset (R2=0.9869) and three independent validation datasets (R2=0.9351, R2=0.8063 and R2=0.9527, respectively). And the performance of the signature was superior to a colorectal-specific TMB estimation model contained 22 genes ({\textasciitilde}0.24 Mbp). Moreover, between TMB-high and TMB-low RCC patients, there were significantly differences in the frequencies of microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylator phenotype, BRAF, KRAS and POLE/POLD1 mutation status (p{\textless}0.01). However, the performances of the signature in other types of cancer were dramatically degraded (left-sided colon cancer, R2=0.7849 and 0.9407, respectively; rectum, R2=0.5955 and R2=0.965, respectively; breast cancer, R2=0.8444; lung cancer, R2=0.5963), suggesting that it was necessary to develop cancer-specific TMB estimated signatures to estimate precisely the TMB in different types of cancer. In summary, we developed an exon signature that can accurately estimate TMB in RCC patients, and the cost and time required for the assessment of TMB can be considerably decreased, making it more suitable for blood and/or biopsy samples.},

However, this technique is expensive and time-consuming, which hampers its application in clinical practice. Therefore, the objective of this study was to construct a mutation load estimation model for lung adenocarcinoma, using a small set of genes, as a predictor of the immunotherapy treatment response. Using the somatic mutation data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, a computational framework was developed. The estimation model consisted of only 24 genes, used to estimate the mutation load in the independent validation cohort precisely (R2 = 0.7626). Additionally, the estimated mutation load can be used to identify the patients with durable clinical benefits, with 85\% sensitivity, 93\% specificity, and 89\% accuracy, indicating that the model can serve as a predictive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy treatment response. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrated the necessity of the cancer-specific models by the constructed melanoma and colorectal models. Since most genes in the lung adenocarcinoma model are not currently included in the sequencing panels, a customized targeted sequencing panel can be designed with the selected model genes to assess the mutation load, instead of whole-exome sequencing or the currently used panel-based methods. Consequently, the cost and time required for the assessment of mutation load may be considerably decreased, which indicates that the presented model is a more cost-effective approach to cancer immunotherapy response prediction in clinical practice.},

Chromatin organization contributes to regional variation in mutation rates, but its contribution differs among mutation types. In both germline and somatic mutations, base substitutions are more abundant in regions of closed chromatin, perhaps reflecting error accumulation late in replication. By contrast, a distinctive mutational state with very high levels of insertions and deletions (indels) and substitutions is enriched in regions of open chromatin. These associations indicate an intricate interplay between the nucleotide sequence of DNA and its dynamic packaging into chromatin, and have important implications for current biomedical research.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Panel sequencing based estimates of tumor mutational burden (psTMB) are increasingly replacing whole exome sequencing (WES) tumor mutational burden as predictive biomarker of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).
DESIGN: A mathematical law describing psTMB variability was derived using a random mutation model and complemented by the contributions of non-randomly mutated real-world cancer genomes and intratumoral heterogeneity through simulations in publicly available datasets.
RESULTS: The coefficient of variation (CV) of psTMB decreased inversely proportional with the square root of the panel size and the square root of the TMB level. In silico simulations of all major commercially available panels in the TCGA pan-cancer cohort confirmed the validity of this mathematical law and demonstrated that the CV was 35\% for TMB = 10 muts/Mbp for the largest panels of size 1.1-1.4 Mbp. Accordingly, misclassification rates (gold standard: WES) to separate 'TMBhigh' from 'TMBlow' using a cut-point of 199 mutations were 10\%-12\% in TCGA-LUAD and 17\%-19\% in TCGA-LUSC. A novel three-tier psTMB classification scheme which accounts for the likelihood of misclassification is proposed. Simulations in two WES datasets of immunotherapy treated patients revealed that small gene panels were poor predictors of ICB response. Moreover, we noted substantial intratumoral variance of psTMB scores in the TRACERx 100 cohort and identified indel burden as independent marker complementing missense mutation burden.
CONCLUSIONS: A universal mathematical law describes accuracy limitations inherent to psTMB, which result in substantial misclassification rates. This scenario can be controlled by two measures: (i) a panel design that is based on the mathematical law described in this article: halving the CV requires a fourfold increase in panel size, (ii) a novel three-tier TMB classification scheme. Moreover, inclusion of indel burden can complement TMB reports. This work has substantial implications for panel design, TMB testing, clinical trials and patient management.},

TMB can be quantitated by a number of NGS-based sequencing technologies. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) allows comprehensive measurement of TMB and is considered the gold standard. However, to date WES remains confined to research settings, due to high cost of the large genomic space sequenced. In the clinical setting, instead, targeted enrichment panels (gene panels) of various genomic sizes are emerging as the routine technology for TMB assessment. This stimulated the development of various methods for panel-based TMB quantification, and prompted the multiplication of studies assessing whether TMB can be confidently estimated from the smaller genomic space sampled by gene panels. In this review, we inventory the collection of available gene panels tested for this purpose, illustrating their technical specifications and describing their accuracy and clinical value in TMB assessment. Moreover, we highlight how various experimental, platform-related or methodological variables, as well as bioinformatic pipelines, influence panel-based TMB quantification. The lack of harmonization in panel-based TMB quantification, of adequate methods to convert TMB estimates across different panels and of robust predictive cutoffs, currently represents one of the main limitations to adopt TMB as a biomarker in clinical practice. This overview on the heterogeneous landscape of panel-based TMB quantification aims at providing a context to discuss common standards and illustrates the strong need of further validation and consolidation studies for the clinical interpretation of panel-based TMB values.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The focus of tumour-specific antigen analyses has been on single nucleotide variants (SNVs), with the contribution of small insertions and deletions (indels) less well characterised. We investigated whether the frameshift nature of indel mutations, which create novel open reading frames and a large quantity of mutagenic peptides highly distinct from self, might contribute to the immunogenic phenotype.
METHODS: We analysed whole-exome sequencing data from 5777 solid tumours, spanning 19 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We compared the proportion and number of indels across the cohort, with a subset of results replicated in two independent datasets. We assessed in-silico tumour-specific neoantigen predictions by mutation type with pan-cancer analysis, together with RNAseq profiling in renal clear cell carcinoma cases (n=392), to compare immune gene expression across patient subgroups. Associations between indel burden and treatment response were assessed across four checkpoint inhibitor datasets.
FINDINGS: We observed renal cell carcinomas to have the highest proportion (0·12) and number of indel mutations across the pan-cancer cohort (p{\textless}2·2 × 10-16), more than double the median proportion of indel mutations in all other cancer types examined. Analysis of tumour-specific neoantigens showed that enrichment of indel mutations for high-affinity binders was three times that of non-synonymous SNV mutations. Furthermore, neoantigens derived from indel mutations were nine times enriched for mutant specific binding, as compared with non-synonymous SNV derived neoantigens. Immune gene expression analysis in the renal clear cell carcinoma cohort showed that the presence of mutant-specific neoantigens was associated with upregulation of antigen presentation genes, which correlated (r=0·78) with T-cell activation as measured by CD8-positive expression. Finally, analysis of checkpoint inhibitor response data revealed frameshift indel count to be significantly associated with checkpoint inhibitor response across three separate melanoma cohorts (p=4·7 × 10-4).
INTERPRETATION: Renal cell carcinomas have the highest pan-cancer proportion and number of indel mutations. Evidence suggests indels are a highly immunogenic mutational class, which can trigger an increased abundance of neoantigens and greater mutant-binding specificity.

	abstract = {Background: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been widely studied as a predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Besides, evidence suggests frameshift indels are a highly immunogenic mutational class and thus a potentially superior biomarker. However, the general prognostic impact of TMB and indel burden in patients with solid tumors has not been systematically investigated.
Methods: We analyzed 20 primary solid cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Clinicopathologic factors, TMB and indel burden were collected or calculated. For each cancer type, the impact of TMB or indel burden on overall survival (OS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression with the method of inverse probability of treatment weighting.
Results: Twenty cancer types from 6,035 patients were analyzed. Survival analysis showed that TMB had a significant impact on OS in 14 out of these 20 cancer types. According to the general survival impact of TMB, they could be classified into three groups, namely the TMB-Worse (eight cancer types), TMB-Better (six cancer types) and TMB-Similar (six cancer types) group, in which higher TMB was associated with inferior, superior, or similar OS, respectively. The survival impacts of TMB in the TMB-Worse and TMB-Better groups were generally consistent when limited to genes from two FDA-approved panels. Notably, in two out of the six cancer types in the TMB-Similar group, the indel burden significantly affected OS.
Conclusions: TMB, as well as indel burden, has divergent prognostic impact in different cancer types, thus could be incorporated in prognostication and risk stratification. More importantly, the general prognostic impact should be taken into account when establishing the predictive function of TMB to ICI treatment.},

PD-L1 testing is required for checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in front-line non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, obtaining adequate tumor tissue for molecular testing in patients with advanced disease can be challenging. Thus, an unmet medical need exists for diagnostic approaches that do not require tissue to identify patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. Here, we describe a novel, technically robust, blood-based assay to measure TMB in plasma (bTMB) that is distinct from tissue-based approaches. Using a retrospective analysis of two large randomized trials as test and validation studies, we show that bTMB reproducibly identifies patients who derive clinically significant improvements in progression-free survival from atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1) in second-line and higher NSCLC. Collectively, our data show that high bTMB is a clinically actionable biomarker for atezolizumab in NSCLC.},

	doi = {10.1093/annonc/mdy495},
	abstract = {Background: Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with agents such as anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and/or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) can result in impressive response rates and durable disease remission but only in a subset of patients with cancer. Expression of PD-L1 has demonstrated utility in selecting patients for response to ICB and has proven to be an important biomarker for patient selection. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is emerging as a potential biomarker. However, refinement of interpretation and contextualization is required.
Materials and methods: In this review, we outline the evolution of TMB as a biomarker in oncology, delineate how TMB can be applied in the clinic, discuss current limitations as a diagnostic test, and highlight mechanistic insights unveiled by the study of TMB. We review available data to date studying TMB as a biomarker for response to ICB by tumor type, focusing on studies proposing a threshold for TMB as a predictive biomarker for ICB activity.
Results: High TMB consistently selects for benefit with ICB therapy. In lung, bladder and head and neck cancers, the current predictive TMB thresholds proposed approximate 200 non-synonymous somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing (WES). PD-L1 expression influences response to ICB in high TMB tumors with single agent PD-(L)1 antibodies; however, response may not be dependent on PD-L1 expression in the setting of anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination therapy. Disease-specific TMB thresholds for effective prediction of response in various other malignancies are not well established.
Conclusions: TMB, in concert with PD-L1 expression, has been demonstrated to be a useful biomarker for ICB selection across some cancer types; however, further prospective validation studies are required. TMB determination by selected targeted panels has been correlated with WES. Calibration and harmonization will be required for optimal utility and alignment across all platforms currently used internationally. Key challenges will need to be addressed before broader use in different tumor types.},

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of TMB in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Databases including Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched to identify potentially eligible studies until Sep 2018 without language limitation. Studies assessing high versus low TMB in predicting survival of various cancer patients were selected. The pooled analyses were conducted using hazard ratio (HR) of high versus low TMB for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the odds ratio (OR) for overall response rate (ORR). The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary outcomes were PFS and ORR. A total of 45 studies consisting of 103078 cancer patients were included. The combined results showed that high TMB was associated with better OS (HR = 0.40; 95\% confidence interval (CI):0.30-0.53; p{\textless} .00001), PFS (HR = 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.26-0.53; p{\textless} .00001) and ORR (OR = 4.62; 95\%CI: 2.90-7.34; p{\textless} .0001) when treated with immunotherapy.

It is urgent to explore some biomarkers to screen the most appropriate cancer patients. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) as a potential alternative has been drawing more and more attention. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively explore the association between TMB and outcomes of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions. Methods: We searched eligible studies that evaluated the association between TMB and the outcomes of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database up to October 2018. The primary endpoints were the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) in patients with high TMB or low TMB. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) for PFS and OS were performed by Stata. Results: In this analysis, a total of 2,661 patients from eight studies were included. Comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions to chemotherapy, the pooled HR for PFS and OS in patients with high TMB was 0.66 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.88; P = 0.004] and 0.73 (95\% CI 0.50 to 1.08; P = 0.114), respectively, while the pooled HR for PFS and OS in patients with low TMB was 1.38 (95\% CI 0.82 to 2.31; P = 0.229) and 1.00 (95\% CI 0.80 to 1.24; P = 0.970), respectively. Meanwhile, comparing patients with high TMB to patients with low TMB, the pooled HR for PFS in patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions was 0.47 (95\% CI 0.35 to 0.63; P = 0.000). Patients with high TMB showed significant benefits from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions compared to patients with low TMB.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In two phase III trials (CheckMate 017 and CheckMate 057), nivolumab showed an improvement in overall survival (OS) and favorable safety versus docetaxel in patients with previously treated, advanced squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, respectively. We report 5-year pooled efficacy and safety from these trials.
METHODS: Patients (N = 854; CheckMate 017/057 pooled) with advanced NSCLC, ECOG PS ≤ 1, and progression during or after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point for both trials was OS; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Exploratory landmark analyses were investigated.
RESULTS: After the minimum follow-up of 64.2 and 64.5 months for CheckMate 017 and 057, respectively, 50 nivolumab-treated patients and nine docetaxel-treated patients were alive. Five-year pooled OS rates were 13.4\% versus 2.6\%, respectively; 5-year PFS rates were 8.0\% versus 0\%, respectively. Nivolumab-treated patients without disease progression at 2 and 3 years had an 82.0\% and 93.0\% chance of survival, respectively, and a 59.6\% and 78.3\% chance of remaining progression-free at 5 years, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 8 of 31 (25.8\%) nivolumab-treated patients between 3-5 years of follow-up, seven of whom experienced new events; one (3.2\%) TRAE was grade 3, and there were no grade 4 TRAEs.
CONCLUSION: At 5 years, nivolumab continued to demonstrate a survival benefit versus docetaxel, exhibiting a five-fold increase in OS rate, with no new safety signals. These data represent the first report of 5-year outcomes from randomized phase III trials of a programmed death-1 inhibitor in previously treated, advanced NSCLC.},

Assuming that common biochemical pathways might be involved in the deaths of 2B4.11 and LyD9, we isolated the PD-1 gene, a novel member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, by using subtractive hybridization technique. The predicted PD-1 protein has a variant form of the consensus sequence found in cytoplasmic tails of signal transducing polypeptides associated with immune recognition receptors. The PD-1 gene was activated in both stimulated 2B4.11 and IL-3-deprived LyD9 cells, but not in other death-induced cell lines that did not show the characteristic features of the classical programmed cell death. Expression of the PD-1 mRNA in mouse was restricted to the thymus and increased when thymocyte death was augmented by in vivo injection of anti-CD3 antibody.

	abstract = {Identifying and understanding changes in cancer genomes is essential for the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we analyse systematically more than 70 pairs of primary human colon tumours by applying next-generation sequencing to characterize their exomes, transcriptomes and copy-number alterations. We have identified 36,303 protein-altering somatic changes that include several new recurrent mutations in the Wnt pathway gene TCF7L2, chromatin-remodelling genes such as TET2 and TET3 and receptor tyrosine kinases including ERBB3. Our analysis for significantly mutated cancer genes identified 23 candidates, including the cell cycle checkpoint kinase ATM. Copy-number and RNA-seq data analysis identified amplifications and corresponding overexpression of IGF2 in a subset of colon tumours. Furthermore, using RNA-seq data we identified multiple fusion transcripts including recurrent gene fusions involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 that together occur in 10\% of colon tumours. The RSPO fusions were mutually exclusive with APC mutations, indicating that they probably have a role in the activation of Wnt signalling and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this we show that the RSPO fusion proteins were capable of potentiating Wnt signalling. The R-spondin gene fusions and several other gene mutations identified in this study provide new potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention in colon cancer.},

We identified recurrently mutated genes in CRC, such as BCL9L, RBM10, CTCF, and KLF5, that were not previously appreciated in this disease. Furthermore, we investigated the genomic correlates of immune-cell infiltration and found that higher neoantigen load was positively associated with overall lymphocytic infiltration, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), memory T cells, and CRC-specific survival. The association with TILs was evident even within microsatellite-stable tumors. We also found positive selection of mutations in HLA genes and other components of the antigen-processing machinery in TIL-rich tumors. These results may inform immunotherapeutic approaches in CRC. More generally, this study demonstrates a framework for future integrative molecular epidemiology research in colorectal and other malignancies.},

Sun-exposed melanomas had markedly more ultraviolet (UV)-like C{\textgreater}T somatic mutations compared to sun-shielded acral, mucosal and uveal melanomas. Among the newly identified cancer genes was PPP6C, encoding a serine/threonine phosphatase, which harbored mutations that clustered in the active site in 12\% of sun-exposed melanomas, exclusively in tumors with mutations in BRAF or NRAS. Notably, we identified a recurrent UV-signature, an activating mutation in RAC1 in 9.2\% of sun-exposed melanomas. This activating mutation, the third most frequent in our cohort of sun-exposed melanoma after those of BRAF and NRAS, changes Pro29 to serine (RAC1(P29S)) in the highly conserved switch I domain. Crystal structures, and biochemical and functional studies of RAC1(P29S) showed that the alteration releases the conformational restraint conferred by the conserved proline, causes an increased binding of the protein to downstream effectors, and promotes melanocyte proliferation and migration. These findings raise the possibility that pharmacological inhibition of downstream effectors of RAC1 signaling could be of therapeutic benefit.},

Integrative analysis reveals enrichment of KIT mutations and focal amplifications and complex structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We found no significant outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned a transcriptomic subclass enriched for immune gene expression associated with lymphocyte infiltrate on pathology review and high LCK protein expression, a T cell marker, were associated with improved patient survival.

Furthermore, we also detected a recurrent fusion involving FGFR3 and TACC3, another component of SCCS, by transcriptome sequencing of 42 DNA-sequenced tumors. Overall, 32 of the 99 tumors (32\%) harbored genetic alterations in the SCCS process.

We illustrate RATE through Bayesian Gaussian process regression, but the methodological innovations apply to other “black box” methods. It is known that nonlinear models often exhibit greater predictive accuracy than linear models, particularly for phenotypes generated by complex genetic architectures. With detailed simulations and two real data association mapping studies, we show that applying RATE enables an explanation for this improved performance.},

	abstract = {Although several dozen studies of gene expression in sepsis have been published, distinguishing sepsis from a sterile systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is still largely up to clinical suspicion. We hypothesized that a multicohort analysis of the publicly available sepsis gene expression data sets would yield a robust set of genes for distinguishing patients with sepsis from patients with sterile inflammation. A comprehensive search for gene expression data sets in sepsis identified 27 data sets matching our inclusion criteria. Five data sets (n = 663 samples) compared patients with sterile inflammation (SIRS/trauma) to time-matched patients with infections. We applied our multicohort analysis framework that uses both effect sizes and P values in a leave-one-data set-out fashion to these data sets. We identified 11 genes that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate ≤1\%, inter–data set heterogeneity P {\textgreater} 0.01, summary effect size {\textgreater}1.5-fold) across all discovery cohorts with excellent diagnostic power [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.87; range, 0.7 to 0.98]. We then validated these 11 genes in 15 independent cohorts comparing (i) time-matched infected versus noninfected trauma patients (4 cohorts), (ii) ICU/trauma patients with infections over the clinical time course (3 cohorts), and (iii) healthy subjects versus sepsis patients (8 cohorts). In the discovery Glue Grant cohort, SIRS plus the 11-gene set improved prediction of infection (compared to SIRS alone) with a continuous net reclassification index of 0.90. Overall, multicohort analysis of time-matched cohorts yielded 11 genes that robustly distinguish sterile inflammation from infectious inflammation.
Five publicly available gene expression cohorts comparing SIRS/trauma to sepsis were split into time-matched subcohorts and summarized via multicohort analysis, which yielded an 11-gene set that was validated for discriminating patients with sepsis or infection in 15 independent cohorts.

In this cohort, IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.86 (95\% CI 0.77–0.93), and viral-vs.-other 0.85 (95\% CI 0.76–0.93). In patients enrolled within 36 h of hospital admission (N = 70), IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.92 (95\% CI 0.83–0.99), and viral-vs.-other 0.91 (95\% CI 0.82–0.98). With further study, IMX-BVN-1 could provide a tool for assessing patients with suspected infection and sepsis at hospital admission.},

	abstract = {Although several dozen studies of gene expression in sepsis have been published, distinguishing sepsis from a sterile systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is still largely up to clinical suspicion. We hypothesized that a multicohort analysis of the publicly available sepsis gene expression data sets would yield a robust set of genes for distinguishing patients with sepsis from patients with sterile inflammation. A comprehensive search for gene expression data sets in sepsis identified 27 data sets matching our inclusion criteria. Five data sets (n = 663 samples) compared patients with sterile inflammation (SIRS/trauma) to time-matched patients with infections. We applied our multicohort analysis framework that uses both effect sizes and P values in a leave-one-data set-out fashion to these data sets. We identified 11 genes that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate ≤1\%, inter–data set heterogeneity P {\textgreater} 0.01, summary effect size {\textgreater}1.5-fold) across all discovery cohorts with excellent diagnostic power [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.87; range, 0.7 to 0.98]. We then validated these 11 genes in 15 independent cohorts comparing (i) time-matched infected versus noninfected trauma patients (4 cohorts), (ii) ICU/trauma patients with infections over the clinical time course (3 cohorts), and (iii) healthy subjects versus sepsis patients (8 cohorts). In the discovery Glue Grant cohort, SIRS plus the 11-gene set improved prediction of infection (compared to SIRS alone) with a continuous net reclassification index of 0.90. Overall, multicohort analysis of time-matched cohorts yielded 11 genes that robustly distinguish sterile inflammation from infectious inflammation.
Five publicly available gene expression cohorts comparing SIRS/trauma to sepsis were split into time-matched subcohorts and summarized via multicohort analysis, which yielded an 11-gene set that was validated for discriminating patients with sepsis or infection in 15 independent cohorts.

	abstract = {We have developed a novel method, termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), that amplifies DNA with high specificity, efficiency and rapidity under isothermal conditions. This method employs a DNA polymerase and a set of four specially designed primers that recognize a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA. An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the target DNA initiates LAMP. The following strand displacement DNA synthesis primed by an outer primer releases a single-stranded DNA. This serves as template for DNA synthesis primed by the second inner and outer primers that hybridize to the other end of the target, which produces a stem–loop DNA structure. In subsequent LAMP cycling one inner primer hybridizes to the loop on the product and initiates displacement DNA synthesis, yielding the original stem–loop DNA and a new stem–loop DNA with a stem twice as long. The cycling reaction continues with accumulation of 109 copies of target in less than an hour. The final products are stem–loop DNAs with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target in the same strand. Because LAMP recognizes the target by six distinct sequences initially and by four distinct sequences afterwards, it is expected to amplify the target sequence with high selectivity.},

The current study involved the optimization of Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the detection of Leishmania DNA in human blood or tissue samples. Three LAMP systems were developed; in two of those the primers were designed based on shared regions of the ITS1 gene among different Leishmania species, while the primers for the third LAMP system were derived from a newly identified repeated region in the Leishmania genome. The LAMP tests were shown to be sufficiently sensitive to detect 0.1pg of DNA from most Leishmania species. The green nucleic acid stain SYTO16, was used here for the first time to allow real-time monitoring of LAMP amplification. The advantage of real time-LAMP using SYTO 16 over end-point LAMP product detection is discussed.

In this paper we study a new aspect of the curse pertaining to the distribution of k-occurrences, i.e., the number of times a point appears among the k nearest neighbors of other points in a data set. We show that, as dimensionality increases, this distribution becomes considerably skewed and hub points emerge (points with very high k-occurrences). We examine the origin of this phenomenon, showing that it is an inherent property of high-dimensional vector space, and explore its influence on applications based on measuring distances in vector spaces, notably classification, clustering, and information retrieval.},

	abstract = {Modern graphical tools have enhanced our ability to learn many things from data directly. With much user-friendly graphical software available, we are encouraged to plot a lot more often than before. The benefits from direct interaction with graphics have been enormous. But trailing behind these high-tech advances is the issue of appropriate guidance on what to plot. There are too many directions to project a high-dimensional data set and unguided plotting can be time-consuming and fruitless. In a recent article, Li set up a statistical framework for study on this issue, based on a notion of effective dimension reduction (edr) directions. They are the directions to project a high dimensional input variable for the purpose of effectively viewing and studying its relationship with an output variable. A methodology, sliced inverse regression, was introduced and shown to be useful in finding edr directions. This article introduces another method for finding edr directions. It begins with the observation that the eigenvectors for the Hessian matrices of the regression function are helpful in the study of the shape of the regression surface. A notation of principal Hessian directions (pHd's) is defined that locates the main axes along which the regression surface shows the largest curvatures in an aggregate sense. We show that pHd's can be used to find edr directions. We further use the celebrated Stein lemma for suggesting estimates. The sampling properties of the estimated pHd's are obtained. A significance test is derived for suggesting the genuineness of a view found by our method. Some versions for implementing this method are discussed, and simulation results and an application to real data are reported. The relationship of this method with exploratory projection pursuit is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Modern advances in computing power have greatly widened scientists' scope in gathering and investigating information from many variables, information which might have been ignored in the past. Yet to effectively scan a large pool of variables is not an easy task, although our ability to interact with data has been much enhanced by recent innovations in dynamic graphics. In this article, we propose a novel data-analytic tool, sliced inverse regression (SIR), for reducing the dimension of the input variable x without going through any parametric or nonparametric model-fitting process. This method explores the simplicity of the inverse view of regression; that is, instead of regressing the univariate output variable y against the multivariate x, we regress x against y. Forward regression and inverse regression are connected by a theorem that motivates this method. The theoretical properties of SIR are investigated under a model of the form, y = f(β1x, ..., βKx, ε), where the βk's are the unknown row vectors. This model looks like a nonlinear regression, except for the crucial difference that the functional form of f is completely unknown. For effectively reducing the dimension, we need only to estimate the space [effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.) space] generated by the βk's. This makes our goal different from the usual one in regression analysis, the estimation of all the regression coefficients. In fact, the βk's themselves are not identifiable without a specific structural form on f. Our main theorem shows that under a suitable condition, if the distribution of x has been standardized to have the zero mean and the identity covariance, the inverse regression curve, E(x ∣ y), will fall into the e.d.r. space. Hence a principal component analysis on the covariance matrix for the estimated inverse regression curve can be conducted to locate its main orientation, yielding our estimates for e.d.r. directions. Furthermore, we use a simple step function to estimate the inverse regression curve. No complicated smoothing is needed. SIR can be easily implemented on personal computers. By simulation, we demonstrate how SIR can effectively reduce the dimension of the input variable from, say, 10 to K = 2 for a data set with 400 observations. The spin-plot of y against the two projected variables obtained by SIR is found to mimic the spin-plot of y against the true directions very well. A chi-squared statistic is proposed to address the issue of whether or not a direction found by SIR is spurious.},

	abstract = {A cancer genome includes many mutations derived from various mutagens and mutational processes, leading to specific mutation patterns. It is known that each mutational process leads to characteristic mutations, and when a mutational process has preferences for mutations, this situation is called a ‘mutation signature.’ Identification of mutation signatures is an important task for elucidation of carcinogenic mechanisms. In previous studies, analyses with statistical approaches (e.g. non-negative matrix factorization and latent Dirichlet allocation) revealed a number of mutation signatures. Nonetheless, strictly speaking, these existing approaches employ an ad hoc method or incorrect approximation to estimate the number of mutation signatures, and the whole picture of mutation signatures is unclear.In this study, we present a novel method for estimating the number of mutation signatures—latent Dirichlet allocation with variational Bayes inference (VB-LDA)—where variational lower bounds are utilized for finding a plausible number of mutation patterns. In addition, we performed cluster analyses for estimated mutation signatures to extract novel mutation signatures that appear in multiple primary lesions. In a simulation with artificial data, we confirmed that our method estimated the correct number of mutation signatures. Furthermore, applying our method in combination with clustering procedures for real mutation data revealed many interesting mutation signatures that have not been previously reported.All the predicted mutation signatures with clustering results are freely available at http://www.f.waseda.jp/mhamada/MS/index.html.

Therapeutic interventions on the germinal centers are tantalizing approaches to improve vaccines or to support rejection of chronic pathogens such as HIV. However, the complexity of the selection processes makes it very hard to make reliable predictions.

Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7\% better than the score of Netflix's own system.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel data-driven framework for the design of targeted gene panels for estimating exome-wide biomarkers in cancer immunotherapy. Our first goal is to develop a generative model for the profile of mutation across the exome, which allows for gene- and variant type-dependent mutation rates. Based on this model, we then propose a new procedure for estimating biomarkers such as Tumour Mutation Burden and Tumour Indel Burden. Our approach allows the practitioner to select a targeted gene panel of a prespecified size, and then construct an estimator that only depends on the selected genes. Alternatively, the practitioner may apply our method to make predictions based on an existing gene panel, or to augment a gene panel to a given size. We demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposal using an annotated mutation dataset from 1144 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients.},

However, the advancement of science and technology brings the new challenge of high-dimensional datasets, where the dimension can be in thousands. In such datasets, LDA is inapplicable. Recently, statisticians have devoted many efforts to creating high-dimensional LDA methods. These methods typically perform variable selection via regularization techniques. Various theoretical results, algorithms, and empirical results support the application of these methods.

We apply a density-ratio estimator for approximating squared-loss mutual information that is formulated as a minimum contrast estimator on parametric or nonparametric models. Since cross-validation is available for choosing an appropriate model, our method does not require any prespecified structure on the underlying distributions. We elucidate the asymptotic bias of our estimator on parametric models and the asymptotic convergence rate on nonparametric models. The convergence analysis utilizes the uniform tail-bound of a U-process, and the convergence rate is characterized by the bracketing entropy of the model. We then develop a natural gradient algorithm on the Grassmann manifold for sufficient subspace search. The analytic formula of our estimator allows us to compute the gradient efficiently.

In many of these problem domains, the row–column space structure of a low rank matrix carries information about some underlying phenomenon, and it is of interest in inferential settings to evaluate the extent to which the row–column spaces of an estimated low rank matrix signify discoveries about the phenomenon. However, in contrast with variable selection, we lack a formal framework to assess true or false discoveries in low rank estimation; in particular, the key source of difficulty is that the standard notion of a discovery is a discrete notion that is ill suited to the smooth structure underlying low rank matrices. We address this challenge via a geometric reformulation of the concept of a discovery, which then enables a natural definition in the low rank case. We describe and analyse a generalization of the stability selection method of Meinshausen and Bühlmann to control for false discoveries in low rank estimation, and we demonstrate its utility compared with previous approaches via numerical experiments.},

Our random-projection ensemble classifier then aggregates the results of applying the base classifier on the selected projections, with a data-driven voting threshold to determine the final assignment. Our theoretical results elucidate the effect on performance of increasing the number of projections. Moreover, under a boundary condition that is implied by the sufficient dimension reduction assumption, we show that the test excess risk of the random-projection ensemble classifier can be controlled by terms that do not depend on the original data dimension and a term that becomes negligible as the number of projections increases. The classifier is also compared empirically with several other popular high dimensional classifiers via an extensive simulation study, which reveals its excellent finite sample performance.},

It is now clear that tumours co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Because many of the immune checkpoints are initiated by ligand–receptor interactions, they can be readily blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies were the first of this class of immunotherapeutics to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.

Here, we summarize current knowledge on TP53 gene variations observed in human cancers and populations, and current clinical applications derived from this knowledge., Various mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor can occur in cancer. These have different “fingerprints” and may serve as biomarkers for distinct tumors and targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {Repetitive sequences are abundant in the human genome. Different classes of repetitive DNA sequences, including simple repeats, tandem repeats, segmental duplications, interspersed repeats, and other elements, collectively span more than 50\% of the genome. Because repeat sequences occur in the genome at different scales they can cause various types of sequence analysis errors, including in alignment, de novo assembly, and annotation, among others. This mini-review highlights the challenges introduced by small-scale repeat sequences, especially near-identical tandem or closely located repeats and short tandem repeats, for discovering DNA insertion and deletion (indel) mutations from next-generation sequencing data. We also discuss the de Bruijn graph sequence assembly paradigm that is emerging as the most popular and promising approach for detecting indels. The human exome is taken as an example and highlights how these repetitive elements can obscure or introduce errors while detecting these types of mutations.},

In one-parameter models or when a single coefficient is estimated at a time, this result implies a generic soft-thresholding mechanism which leads to a novel coordinate descent algorithm for generalised linear models that is entirely described in terms of the natural formulation of the model and is guaranteed to converge to the true optimum. A prototype implementation for logistic regression tested on two large-scale cancer gene expression datasets shows that this algorithm is efficient, particularly so when a solution is computed at set values of the ℓ1-penalty parameter as opposed to along a regularisation path.

We call θ̂ a pseudo maximum likelihood estimate of θ, and give conditions under which θ̂ is consistent and asymptotically normal. Pseudo maximum likelihood estimation easily extends to k-parameter models, and is of interest in problems in which the likelihood surface is ill-behaved in higher dimensions but well-behaved in lower dimensions. We examine several signal-plus-noise, or convolution, models which exhibit such behavior and satisfy the regularity conditions of the asymptotic theory. For specific models, a numerical comparison of asymptotic variances suggests that a pseudo maximum likelihood estimate of the signal parameter is uniformly more efficient than estimators proposed previously.},

	abstract = {Gene or protein expression data are usually represented by metric or at least ordinal variables. In order to translate a continuous variable into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point and to stratify patients into two groups each requiring a different kind of treatment. Currently, there is no standard method or standard software for biomarker cutoff determination. Therefore, we developed Cutoff Finder, a bundle of optimization and visualization methods for cutoff determination that is accessible online. While one of the methods for cutoff optimization is based solely on the distribution of the marker under investigation, other methods optimize the correlation of the dichotomization with respect to an outcome or survival variable. We illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the analysis of the gene expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues. This distribution of these important markers is analyzed and correlated with immunohistologically determined ER status and distant metastasis free survival. Cutoff Finder is expected to fill a relevant gap in the available biometric software repertoire and will enable faster optimization of new diagnostic biomarkers.

Different genetic instability processes result in distinct non-random patterns of DNA mutations, also known as mutational signatures. We developed \textit{mutSignatures}, an integrated R-based computational framework aimed at deciphering DNA mutational signatures. Our software provides advanced functions for importing DNA variants, computing mutation types, and extracting mutational signatures via non-negative matrix factorization. We applied \textit{mutSignatures} to analyze somatic mutations found in smoking-related cancer datasets. We characterized mutational signatures that were consistent with those reported before in independent investigations. Our work demonstrates that selected mutational signatures correlated with specific clinical and molecular features across different cancer types, and revealed complementarity of specific mutational patterns that has not previously been identified. In conclusion, we propose \textit{mutSignatures} as a powerful open-source tool for detecting the molecular determinants of cancer and gathering insights into cancer biology and treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It has recently become apparent that CTLA-4, a second counterreceptor for the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is a negative regulator of T cell activation. Here, in vivo administration of antibodies to CTLA-4 resulted in the rejection of tumors, including preestablished tumors. Furthermore, this rejection resulted in immunity to a secondary exposure to tumor cells. These results suggest that blockade of the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 can allow for, and potentiate, effective immune responses against tumor cells.},

	abstract = {In 2011, Bristol-Myers Squibb set the price of its newly approved melanoma drug ipilimumab—
brand name Yervoy—at \$120,000 for a course of therapy. The drug was associated with an
incremental increase in life expectancy of four months. Drugs like ipilimumab have fueled the
perception that the launch prices of new anticancer drugs and other drugs in the so-called
"specialty" pharmaceutical market have been increasing over time and that increases are unrelated
to the magnitude of the expected health benefits. In this paper, we discuss the unique features of
the market for anticancer drugs and assess trends in the launch prices for 58 anticancer drugs
approved between 1995 and 2013 in the United States. We restrict attention to anticancer drugs
because the use of median survival time as a primary outcome measure provides a common,
objective scale for quantifying the incremental benefit of new products. We find that the average
launch price of anticancer drugs, adjusted for inflation and health benefits, increased by 10
percent annually—or an average of \$8,500 per year—from 1995 to 2013. We argue that the
institutional features of the market for anticancer drugs enable manufacturers to set the prices of
new products at or slightly above the prices of existing therapies, giving rise to an upward trend in
launch prices. Government-mandated price discounts for certain classes of buyers may have also
contributed to launch price increases as firms sought to offset the growth in the discount segment
by setting higher prices for the remainder of the market.},

Understanding genomic correlates of response and resistance to checkpoint blockade may enhance benefits for patients with cancer by elucidating biomarkers for patient stratification and resistance mechanisms for therapeutic targeting. Here we review emerging genomic markers of checkpoint blockade response, including those related to neoantigens, antigen presentation, DNA repair, and oncogenic pathways. Compelling evidence also points to a role for T cell functionality, checkpoint regulators, chromatin modifiers, and copy-number alterations in mediating selective response to immune checkpoint blockade. Ultimately, efforts to contextualize genomic correlates of response into the larger understanding of tumor immune biology will build a foundation for the development of novel biomarkers and therapies to overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.5161},
	abstract = {Importance: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is increasingly used in the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) can interfere with cfDNA testing and cause incorrect interpretation of results. There is an urgent need to better understand this problem following recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of poly(ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for metastatic prostate cancer based on variants in DNA repair genes that can be affected by CHIP.
Objective: To determine the prevalence of clinically relevant CHIP interference in prostate cancer cfDNA testing.
Design, Setting, and Participants: We report a case series of 69 patients with advanced prostate cancer (metastatic disease or with rising PSA following localized therapy) who had cfDNA variant testing with a large panel cancer next generation sequencing assay (UW-OncoPlexCT). To determine the source of variants in plasma, we tested paired cfDNA and whole blood control samples. The study was carried out in an academic medical center system reference laboratory.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and gene spectrum of CHIP interference in patients with prostate cancer undergoing cfDNA testing.
Results: We detected CHIP variants at 2\% or more variant fraction in cfDNA from 13 of 69 men with prostate cancer (19\%; 95\% CI, 10\%-30\%). Seven men (10\%; 95\% CI, 4\%-20\%) had CHIP variants in DNA repair genes used to determine PARPi candidacy, including ATM (n = 5), BRCA2 (n = 1), and CHEK2 (n = 1). Overall, CHIP variants accounted for almost half of the somatic DNA repair gene variants detected. Participant CHIP variants were exponentially correlated with older age (R2 = 0.82). CHIP interference variants could be distinguished from prostate cancer variants using a paired whole-blood control.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, approximately 10\% of men with advanced prostate cancer had CHIP interference in plasma cfDNA in DNA repair genes that are used for eligibility of PARPi therapy, most frequently in ATM. Clinical cfDNA testing should include a paired whole-blood control to exclude CHIP variants and avoid misdiagnosis.},

	abstract = {Although substantial progress has been made over the past 40 years in treating patients with cancer, effective therapies for those who are diagnosed with advanced metastatic disease are still few and far between. Cancer cells do not exist in isolation: rather, they exist within a complex microenvironment composed of stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Within this tumour microenvironment exists an interplay between the two main stromal cell subtypes, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells, that are important in controlling metastasis. A complex network of paracrine signalling pathways between CAFs, immune cells and tumour cells are involved at multiple stages of the metastatic process, from invasion and intravasation at the primary tumour site to extravasation and colonisation in the metastatic site. Heterogeneity and plasticity within stromal cell populations also contribute to the complexity. Although many of these processes are likely to be common to a number of metastatic sites, we will describe in detail the interplay within the liver, a preferred site of metastasis for many tumours. A greater understanding of these networks provides opportunities for the design of new therapeutic approaches for targeting the metastatic disease.},

The TST panel was clinically validated in 81 tumors (99\% hotspot mutation concordance), after which 533 consecutive NSCLCs were collected during one-year of routine clinical analysis in the healthcare region (˜90\% advanced stage patients).

Ten gene fusions (five ALK, three RET, two ROS1) were detected in 135 successfully analyzed cases (80\% analysis success rate). No ALK or ROS1 FISH fusion positive case was missed by the NanoString assay. Stratification of the 533-sample cohort based on actionable alterations in 11 oncogenes revealed that 66\% of adenocarcinomas, 13\% of squamous carcinoma (SqCC) and 56\% of NSCLC not otherwise specified harbored ≥1 alteration. In adenocarcinoma, 10.6\% of patients (50.3\% if including KRAS) could potentially be eligible for emerging therapeutics, in addition to the 15.3\% of patients eligible for standard EGFR or ALK inhibitors. For squamous carcinoma corresponding proportions were 4.4\% (11.1\% with KRAS) vs 2.2\%. In conclusion, multiplexed NGS and gene fusion analyses are feasible in NSCLC for clinical diagnostics, identifying notable proportions of patients potentially eligible for emerging molecular therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The identification of tumour mutational burden (TMB) as a biomarker of response to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy has necessitated the development of genomic assays to measure this. We carried out comprehensive molecular profiling of cancers using the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500) panel and compared these to whole-genome sequencing (WGS).

Methods
Cancer samples derived from formalin-fixed material were profiled on the TSO500 panel, sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument and processed through the TSO500 Docker pipeline. Either FASTQ files (PierianDx) or vcf files (OncoKDM) were processed to understand clinical actionability.

Results
In total, 108 samples (a mixture of colorectal, lung, oesophageal and control samples) were processed via the DNA panel. There was good correlation between TMB, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels and copy-number variations as predicted by TSO500 and WGS (R2 {\textgreater} 0.9) and good reproducibility, with less than 5\% variability between repeated controls. For the RNA panel, 13 samples were processed, with all known fusions observed via orthogonal techniques. For clinical actionability, 72 tier 1 variants and 297 tier 2 variants were detected, with clinical trials identified for all patients.

Conclusions
The TSO500 assay accurately measures TMB, microsatellite instability, SNVs, indels, copy-number/structural variation and gene fusions when compared to WGS and orthogonal technologies. Coupled with a clinical annotation pipeline, this provides a powerful methodology for identification of clinically actionable variants.

Develop and apply a comprehensive and accurate next-generation sequencing based assay to help clinicians to match oncology patients to therapies.

Materials \& methods:
The performance of the CANCERPLEX® assay was assessed using DNA from well-characterized routine clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and cell lines.

Results:
The maximum sensitivity of the assay is 99.5\% and its accuracy is virtually 100\% for detecting somatic alterations with an allele fraction of as low as 10\%. Clinically actionable variants were identified in 93\% of patients (930 of 1000) who underwent testing.

Conclusion:
The test's capacity to determine all of the critical genetic changes, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability status and viral associations has important ramifications on clinical decision support strategies, including identification of patients who are likely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockage therapies.},

Over the last forty years since first discovered, Reg proteins have been implicated in a gamut of maladies including diabetes, various types of cancer of the digestive tract, and Alzheimer disease. Surprisingly though, a consensus is still absent on the regulation of their expression, and molecular underpinning of their function. Here, we provide a critical appraisal of recent findings in the field of Reg protein biology. Specifically, the structural characteristics are reviewed particularly in connection with established or purported functions of different members of the Reg family. Moreover, Reg expression patterns in different tissues both under normal and pathophysiological conditions are summarized. Putative receptors and cascades reported to relay Reg signaling inciting cellular responses are presented aiming at a better appreciation of the biological activities of the distinct Reg moieties. Challenges are also discussed that have hampered thus far the rapid progress in this field such as the use of non-standard nomenclature for Reg molecules among various research groups, the existence of multiple Reg members with significant degree of homology and possibly compensatory modes of action, and the need for common assays with robust readouts of Reg activity. Coordinated research is warranted going forward, given that several research groups have independently linked Reg proteins to diseased states and raised the possibility that these biomolecules can serve as therapeutic targets and biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Forty years of research have established that the p53 tumor suppressor provides a major barrier to neoplastic transformation and tumor progression by its unique ability to act as an extremely sensitive collector of stress inputs, and to coordinate a complex framework of diverse effector pathways and processes that protect cellular homeostasis and genome stability. Missense mutations in the TP53 gene are extremely widespread in human cancers and give rise to mutant p53 proteins that lose tumor suppressive activities, and some of which exert trans-dominant repression over the wild-type counterpart. Cancer cells acquire selective advantages by retaining mutant forms of the protein, which radically subvert the nature of the p53 pathway by promoting invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. In this review, we consider available evidence suggesting that mutant p53 proteins can favor cancer cell survival and tumor progression by acting as homeostatic factors that sense and protect cancer cells from transformation-related stress stimuli, including DNA lesions, oxidative and proteotoxic stress, metabolic inbalance, interaction with the tumor microenvironment, and the immune system. These activities of mutant p53 may explain cancer cell addiction to this particular oncogene, and their study may disclose tumor vulnerabilities and synthetic lethalities that could be exploited for hitting tumors bearing missense TP53 mutations.},

	abstract = {A well-known drawback of ℓ1ℓ1{\textbackslash}ell\_\{1\}-penalized estimators is the systematic shrinkage of the large coefficients towards zero. A simple remedy is to treat Lasso as a model-selection procedure and to perform a second refitting step on the selected support. In this work, we formalize the notion of refitting and provide oracle bounds for arbitrary refitting procedures of the Lasso solution. One of the most widely used refitting techniques which is based on Least-Squares may bring a problem of interpretability, since the signs of the refitted estimator might be flipped with respect to the original estimator. This problem arises from the fact that the Least-Squares refitting considers only the support of the Lasso solution, avoiding any information about signs or amplitudes. To this end, we define a sign consistent refitting as an arbitrary refitting procedure, preserving the signs of the first step Lasso solution and provide Oracle inequalities for such estimators. Finally, we consider special refitting strategies: Bregman Lasso and Boosted Lasso. Bregman Lasso has a fruitful property to converge to the Sign-Least-Squares refitting (Least-Squares with sign constraints), which provides with greater interpretability. We additionally study the Bregman Lasso refitting in the case of orthogonal design, providing with simple intuition behind the proposed method. Boosted Lasso, in contrast, considers information about magnitudes of the first Lasso step and allows to develop better oracle rates for prediction. Finally, we conduct an extensive numerical study to show advantages of one approach over others in different synthetic and semi-real scenarios.},

	abstract = {We study tools for inference conditioned on model selection events that are defined by the generalized lasso regularization path. The generalized lasso estimate is given by the solution of a penalized least squares regression problem, where the penalty is the ℓ1ℓ1{\textbackslash}ell\_\{1\} norm of a matrix DDD times the coefficient vector. The generalized lasso path collects these estimates as the penalty parameter λλ{\textbackslash}lambda varies (from ∞∞{\textbackslash}infty down to 0). Leveraging a (sequential) characterization of this path from Tibshirani and Taylor [37], and recent advances in post-selection inference from Lee at al. [22], Tibshirani et al. [38], we develop exact hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for linear contrasts of the underlying mean vector, conditioned on any model selection event along the generalized lasso path (assuming Gaussian errors in the observations). Our construction of inference tools holds for any penalty matrix DDD. By inspecting specific choices of DDD, we obtain post-selection tests and confidence intervals for specific cases of generalized lasso estimates, such as the fused lasso, trend filtering, and the graph fused lasso. In the fused lasso case, the underlying coordinates of the mean are assigned a linear ordering, and our framework allows us to test selectively chosen breakpoints or changepoints in these mean coordinates. This is an interesting and well-studied problem with broad applications; our framework applied to the trend filtering and graph fused lasso cases serves several applications as well. Aside from the development of selective inference tools, we describe several practical aspects of our methods such as (valid, i.e., fully-accounted-for) post-processing of generalized lasso estimates before performing inference in order to improve power, and problem-specific visualization aids that may be given to the data analyst for he/she to choose linear contrasts to be tested. Many examples, from both simulated and real data sources, are presented to examine the empirical properties of our inference methods.},

Variable selection plays a pivotal role in contemporary statistical learning and scientific discoveries. The traditional idea of best subset selection methods, which can be regarded as a specific form of penalized likelihood, is computationally too expensive for many modern statistical applications. Other forms of penalized likelihood methods have been successfully developed over the last decade to cope with high dimensionality. They have been widely applied for simultaneously selecting important variables and estimating their effects in high dimensional statistical inference. In this article, we present a brief account of the recent developments of theory, methods, and implementations for high dimensional variable selection. What limits of the dimensionality such methods can handle, what the role of penalty functions is, and what the statistical properties are rapidly drive the advances of the field. The properties of non-concave penalized likelihood and its roles in high dimensional statistical modeling are emphasized. We also review some recent advances in ultra-high dimensional variable selection, with emphasis on independence screening and two-scale methods.},

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from the pan-cancer cohort (n = 10,224) of TCGA, and targeted sequencing (tNGS) and TTN gene sequencing from 24 colorectal cancer samples (AMC cohort) were analyzed. TTN was identified as the most frequently mutated gene within the pan-cancer cohort, and its mutation number best correlated with TMB assessed by WES (rho = 0.917, p {\textless} 2.2e-16). Colorectal cancer was one of good candidates for the application of this diagnostic model of TTN-TMB, and the correlation coefficients were 0.936 and 0.92 for TMB by WES and TMB by tNGS, respectively. Higher than expected TTN mutation frequencies observed in other FLAGS (FrequentLy mutAted GeneS) are associated with late replication time. Diagnostic accuracy for high TMB group did not differ between TTN-TMB and TMB assessed by tNGS. Classification modeling by machine learning using TTN-TMB for MSI-H diagnosis was constructed, and the diagnostic accuracy was 0.873 by area under the curve in external validation. TTN mutation was enriched in samples possessing high immunostimulatory signatures. We suggest that the mutation load within TTN represents high TMB status.},

Recent clinical studies have associated high TMB with improved patient response rates and survival benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors; hence, TMB is emerging as a biomarker of response for these immunotherapy agents. However, variability in current methods for TMB estimation and reporting is evident, demonstrating a need for standardization and harmonization of TMB assessment methodology across assays and centers. Two uniquely placed organizations, Friends of Cancer Research (Friends) and the Quality Assurance Initiative Pathology (QuIP), have collaborated to coordinate efforts for international multistakeholder initiatives to address this need. Friends and QuIP, who have partnered with several academic centers, pharmaceutical organizations, and diagnostic companies, have adopted complementary, multidisciplinary approaches toward the goal of proposing evidence-based recommendations for achieving consistent TMB estimation and reporting in clinical samples across assays and centers. Many factors influence TMB assessment, including preanalytical factors, choice of assay, and methods of reporting. Preliminary analyses highlight the importance of targeted gene panel size and composition, and bioinformatic parameters for reliable TMB estimation. Herein, Friends and QuIP propose recommendations toward consistent TMB estimation and reporting methods in clinical samples across assays and centers. These recommendations should be followed to minimize variability in TMB estimation and reporting, which will ensure reliable and reproducible identification of patients who are likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.},

However, despite the significant survival benefit for some patients with advanced NSCLC, the objective response rates (ORRs) remain relatively low no more than 20–30\% with a large proportion of patients demonstrating primary resistance. Although the selection of NSCLC patients for the first-line treatment is currently guided by the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry, this is not the case for the second-line setting. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of PD-L1 expression is modest which has prompted the search for additional predictive biomarkers. In this context, the assessment of the tumor mutational burden (TMB), defined as the total number of nonsynonymous mutations in the coding regions of genes, has recently emerged as an additional powerful biomarker to select patients for immunotherapy.

The immunogenicity model could significantly improve the prediction precision of neoantigens. The further application of our method to the mutations with pre-existing T-cell responses indicating its feasibility in clinical application.

	abstract = {Neoantigens are newly formed peptides created from somatic mutations that are capable of inducing tumor-specific T cell recognition. Recently, researchers and clinicians have leveraged next generation sequencing technologies to identify neoantigens and to create personalized immunotherapies for cancer treatment. To create a personalized cancer vaccine, neoantigens must be computationally predicted from matched tumor–normal sequencing data, and then ranked according to their predicted capability in stimulating a T cell response. This candidate neoantigen prediction process involves multiple steps, including somatic mutation identification, HLA typing, peptide processing, and peptide-MHC binding prediction. The general workflow has been utilized for many preclinical and clinical trials, but there is no current consensus approach and few established best practices. In this article, we review recent discoveries, summarize the available computational tools, and provide analysis considerations for each step, including neoantigen prediction, prioritization, delivery, and validation methods. In addition to reviewing the current state of neoantigen analysis, we provide practical guidance, specific recommendations, and extensive discussion of critical concepts and points of confusion in the practice of neoantigen characterization for clinical use. Finally, we outline necessary areas of development, including the need to improve HLA class II typing accuracy, to expand software support for diverse neoantigen sources, and to incorporate clinical response data to improve neoantigen prediction algorithms. The ultimate goal of neoantigen characterization workflows is to create personalized vaccines that improve patient outcomes in diverse cancer types.},

As successful use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy become a clinical reality, the need for widely applicable, accessible, and reliable immunooncology biomarkers is clear. In part 1 of this review we briefly discuss the host immune response to tumors and different approaches to TIL assessment. We propose a standardized methodology to assess TILs in solid tumors on hematoxylin and eosin sections, in both primary and metastatic settings, based on the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group guidelines for TIL assessment in invasive breast carcinoma. A review of the literature regarding the value of TIL assessment in different solid tumor types follows in part 2. The method we propose is reproducible, affordable, easily applied, and has demonstrated prognostic and predictive significance in invasive breast carcinoma. This standardized methodology may be used as a reference against which other methods are compared, and should be evaluated for clinical validity and utility. Standardization of TIL assessment will help to improve consistency and reproducibility in this field, enrich both the quality and quantity of comparable evidence, and help to thoroughly evaluate the utility of TILs assessment in this era of immunotherapy.},

Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers. Ipilimumab, an inhibitor of CTLA-4, is approved for the treatment of advanced or unresectable melanoma. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, both PD-1 inhibitors, are approved to treat patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma and patients with metastatic, refractory non-small cell lung cancer. In addition the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has been approved in patients with BRAF WT metastatic or unresectable melanoma. The roles of CTLA-4 and PD-1 in inhibiting immune responses, including antitumor responses, are largely distinct. CTLA-4 is thought to regulate T-cell proliferation early in an immune response, primarily in lymph nodes, whereas PD-1 suppresses T cells later in an immune response, primarily in peripheral tissues. The clinical profiles of immuno-oncology agents inhibiting these 2 checkpoints may vary based on their mechanistic differences.

From a theoretical perspective, neoantigen is an ideal immunotherapy target because they are distinguished from germline and could be recognized as non-self by the host immune system. Neoantigen-based therapeutic personalized vaccines and adoptive T cell transfer have shown promising preliminary results. Furthermore, recent studies suggested the significant role of neoantigen in immune escape, immunoediting, and sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent advances of understanding and identification of tumor-specific neoantigens and its role on current cancer immunotherapies.

	abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or “mutation signatures” at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5′ to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with “mixed-membership models” which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods. Our methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature\_shiny/.},

Our framework is flexible and may be used to construct an omnibus test or directed against testing specific non-linearities and interaction effects, or for testing the significance of groups of variables. The methodology is based on extracting left-over signal in the residuals from an initial fit of a generalized linear model. This can be achieved by predicting this signal from the residuals using modern flexible regression or machine learning methods such as random forests or boosted trees. Under the null hypothesis that the generalized linear model is correct, no signal is left in the residuals and our test statistic has a Gaussian limiting distribution, translating to asymptotic control of type I error. Under a local alternative, we establish a guarantee on the power of the test. We illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology on simulated and real data examples by testing goodness-of-fit in logistic regression models.

Nevertheless, there are heterogeneous response rates to ICI among different cancer types, and even in the context of patients affected by a specific cancer. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify factors that predict the response to immunotherapeutic approaches. A comprehensive investigation of the mutational and immunological aspects of the tumor can be useful to obtain a robust prediction. By performing a pan-cancer analysis on gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, 8055 cases and 29 cancer types), we set up and validated a machine learning approach to predict the potential for positive response to ICI. Support vector machines (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) models were developed with a 10×5-fold cross-validation schema on 80\% of TCGA cases to predict ICI responsiveness defined by a score combining tumor mutational burden and TGF-β signaling. On the remaining 20\% validation subset, our SVM model scored 0.88 accuracy and 0.27 Matthews Correlation Coefficient.
