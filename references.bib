	abstract = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is among the most classical classification techniques, while it continues to be a popular and important classifier in practice. However, the advancement of science and technology brings the new challenge of high-dimensional datasets, where the dimension can be in thousands. In such datasets, LDA is inapplicable. Recently, statisticians have devoted many efforts to creating high-dimensional LDA methods. These methods typically perform variable selection via regularization techniques. Various theoretical results, algorithms, and empirical results support the application of these methods. In this review, we provide a brief description of difficulties in extending LDA and present some successful proposals.

In this letter, we propose a novel sufficient dimension-reduction method using a squared-loss variant of mutual information as a dependency measure. We apply a density-ratio estimator for approximating squared-loss mutual information that is formulated as a minimum contrast estimator on parametric or nonparametric models. Since cross-validation is available for choosing an appropriate model, our method does not require any prespecified structure on the underlying distributions. We elucidate the asymptotic bias of our estimator on parametric models and the asymptotic convergence rate on nonparametric models. The convergence analysis utilizes the uniform tail-bound of a U-process, and the convergence rate is characterized by the bracketing entropy of the model. We then develop a natural gradient algorithm on the Grassmann manifold for sufficient subspace search. The analytic formula of our estimator allows us to compute the gradient efficiently. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with existing dimension-reduction approaches on artificial and benchmark data sets.},

We first show that PCA can be formulated as a regression-type optimization problem; sparse loadings are then obtained by imposing the lasso (elastic net) constraint on the regression coefficients. Efficient algorithms are proposed to fit our SPCA models for both regular multivariate data and gene expression arrays.

In many of these problem domains, the row–column space structure of a low rank matrix carries information about some underlying phenomenon, and it is of interest in inferential settings to evaluate the extent to which the row–column spaces of an estimated low rank matrix signify discoveries about the phenomenon. However, in contrast with variable selection, we lack a formal framework to assess true or false discoveries in low rank estimation; in particular, the key source of difficulty is that the standard notion of a discovery is a discrete notion that is ill suited to the smooth structure underlying low rank matrices. We address this challenge via a geometric reformulation of the concept of a discovery, which then enables a natural definition in the low rank case. We describe and analyse a generalization of the stability selection method of Meinshausen and Bühlmann to control for false discoveries in low rank estimation, and we demonstrate its utility compared with previous approaches via numerical experiments.},

Our random-projection ensemble classifier then aggregates the results of applying the base classifier on the selected projections, with a data-driven voting threshold to determine the final assignment. Our theoretical results elucidate the effect on performance of increasing the number of projections. Moreover, under a boundary condition that is implied by the sufficient dimension reduction assumption, we show that the test excess risk of the random-projection ensemble classifier can be controlled by terms that do not depend on the original data dimension and a term that becomes negligible as the number of projections increases. The classifier is also compared empirically with several other popular high dimensional classifiers via an extensive simulation study, which reveals its excellent finite sample performance.},

It is urgent to explore some biomarkers to screen the most appropriate cancer patients. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) as a potential alternative has been drawing more and more attention. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively explore the association between TMB and outcomes of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions., 
Methods: We searched eligible studies that evaluated the association between TMB and the outcomes of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database up to October 2018. The primary endpoints were the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) in patients with high TMB or low TMB. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) for PFS and OS were performed by Stata., 
Results: In this analysis, a total of 2,661 patients from eight studies were included. Comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions to chemotherapy, the pooled HR for PFS and OS in patients with high TMB was 0.66 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.88; P = 0.004] and 0.73 (95\% CI 0.50 to 1.08; P = 0.114), respectively, while the pooled HR for PFS and OS in patients with low TMB was 1.38 (95\% CI 0.82 to 2.31; P = 0.229) and 1.00 (95\% CI 0.80 to 1.24; P = 0.970), respectively. Meanwhile, comparing patients with high TMB to patients with low TMB, the pooled HR for PFS in patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions was 0.47 (95\% CI 0.35 to 0.63; P = 0.000). Patients with high TMB showed significant benefits from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions compared to patients with low TMB., 
Conclusion: Despite the present technical and practical barriers, TMB may be a preferable biomarker to optimize the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitions.},

Besides, evidence suggests frameshift indels are a highly immunogenic mutational class and thus a potentially superior biomarker. However, the general prognostic impact of TMB and indel burden in patients with solid tumors has not been systematically investigated. 
 Methods:  We analyzed 20 primary solid cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Clinicopathologic factors, TMB and indel burden were collected or calculated. For each cancer type, the impact of TMB or indel burden on overall survival (OS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression with the method of inverse probability of treatment weighting.
 Results:  Twenty cancer types from 6,035 patients were analyzed. Survival analysis showed that TMB had a significant impact on OS in 14 out of these 20 cancer types. According to the general survival impact of TMB, they could be classified into three groups, namely the TMB-Worse (eight cancer types), TMB-Better (six cancer types) and TMB-Similar (six cancer types) group, in which higher TMB was associated with inferior, superior, or similar OS, respectively. The survival impacts of TMB in the TMB-Worse and TMB-Better groups were generally consistent when limited to genes from two FDA-approved panels. Notably, in two out of the six cancer types in the TMB-Similar group, the indel burden significantly affected OS. 
 Conclusions:  TMB, as well as indel burden, has divergent prognostic impact in different cancer types, thus could be incorporated in prognostication and risk stratification. More importantly, the general prognostic impact should be taken into account when establishing the predictive function of TMB to ICI treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: Several studies have demonstrated the potential clinical utility of TMB as a biomarker of immune checkpoint blockade in multiple tumor types, including lung cancer. Prior analyses have been retrospective and exploratory, with varying cutoffs and methodologies used to assess TMB. The establishment of a clinically validated cutoff for nivo + ipi is required to confirm the clinical utility of TMB as a predictive biomarker in future studies. CheckMate 568 (NCT02659059) is a large, single-arm, phase 2 study of nivo + ipi in 1L NSCLC. TMB was assessed using Foundation One CDx™ (Foundation Medicine, Inc.) to identify an appropriate TMB cutoff to select patients for 1L nivo + ipi therapy. This cutoff was subsequently validated through a preplanned analysis in CheckMate 227, which evaluated progression-free survival in patients with high TMB as a co-primary endpoint (NCT02477826).
Methods: In CheckMate 568, 288 patients with chemotherapy-naive stage IV NSCLC received nivo 3 mg/kg Q2W + ipi 1 mg/kg Q6W for up to 2 years. EGFR- and ALK-targetable NSCLC were excluded. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as per independent review. ORR by TMB was a secondary endpoint. TMB was assessed using the validated FoundationOne® CDx assay (Foundation Medicine, Inc.). TMB classification performance with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to determine an appropriate TMB cutoff associated with enhanced efficacy of nivo + ipi in 1L NSCLC. Prevalence analyses of TMB and PD-L1 were also conducted.
Results: Baseline characteristics and efficacy were similar in both the all treated and TMB-evaluable populations. With a minimum follow-up of 3 months, ORR was 27\% in all treated patients. ORR increased in patients with higher TMB, and plateaued with the threshold of ≥10 mutations (mut)/Mb (ORR: 4\%, 10\%, 44\%, and 39\% in patients with TMB {\textless}5, {\textless}10, ≥10, and ≥15 mut/Mb, respectively). ROC analysis of TMB vs ORR for nivo + ipi demonstrated optimal classification performance at 10 mut/Mb. The safety profile for nivo + ipi was consistent with previous reports and no new safety signals were observed.
Conclusions: TMB ≥10 mut/Mb was associated with enhanced response to nivo + ipi regardless of PD-L1 expression, with ORRs {\textgreater}40\%. This response rate, coupled with the known durability of responses to immuno-oncology agents, compares favorably to historical data with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Therefore, a cutoff of ≥10 mut/Mb was chosen to define the TMB patient population for the co-primary efficacy endpoint in CheckMate 227.

	abstract = {Among the most promising approaches to activating therapeutic antitumour immunity is the blockade of immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints refer to a plethora of inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological immune responses in peripheral tissues in order to minimize collateral tissue damage. It is now clear that tumours co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Because many of the immune checkpoints are initiated by ligand–receptor interactions, they can be readily blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies were the first of this class of immunotherapeutics to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Preliminary clinical findings with blockers of additional immune-checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), indicate broad and diverse opportunities to enhance antitumour immunity with the potential to produce durable clinical responses.},

This mini-review highlights the challenges introduced by small-scale repeat sequences, especially near-identical tandem or closely located repeats and short tandem repeats, for discovering DNA insertion and deletion (indel) mutations from next-generation sequencing data. We also discuss the de Bruijn graph sequence assembly paradigm that is emerging as the most popular and promising approach for detecting indels.

A prototype implementation for logistic regression tested on two large-scale cancer gene expression datasets shows that this algorithm is efficient, particularly so when a solution is computed at set values of the ℓ1-penalty parameter as opposed to along a regularisation path.

Therapeutic approaches for treating cancers with such mutations have focused on targeting the downstream protein effectors of KRAS. However, to date, no approved treatment has targeted the mutated KRAS oncogene directly. Presently, we used the selectivity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly target mutated KRAS alleles. We designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target two specific single-nucleotide missense mutations on KRAS codon-12 located in the seed region adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Lentiviral transduction of Cas9 and the sgRNAs into cancer cells with respective KRAS mutations resulted in high frequency of indels in the seed region. Indel-associated disruption of the mutant KRAS alleles correlated with reduced viability of the cancer cells. The results indicate that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing can potentially be used for the treatment of cancer patients, specifically those with oncogenic KRAS mutations.},

TMB can be quantitated by a number of NGS-based sequencing technologies. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) allows comprehensive measurement of TMB and is considered the gold standard. However, to date WES remains confined to research settings, due to high cost of the large genomic space sequenced. In the clinical setting, instead, targeted enrichment panels (gene panels) of various genomic sizes are emerging as the routine technology for TMB assessment. This stimulated the development of various methods for panel-based TMB quantification, and prompted the multiplication of studies assessing whether TMB can be confidently estimated from the smaller genomic space sampled by gene panels. In this review, we inventory the collection of available gene panels tested for this purpose, illustrating their technical specifications and describing their accuracy and clinical value in TMB assessment. Moreover, we highlight how various experimental, platform-related or methodological variables, as well as bioinformatic pipelines, influence panel-based TMB quantification. The lack of harmonization in panel-based TMB quantification, of adequate methods to convert TMB estimates across different panels and of robust predictive cutoffs, currently represents one of the main limitations to adopt TMB as a biomarker in clinical practice. This overview on the heterogeneous landscape of panel-based TMB quantification aims at providing a context to discuss common standards and illustrates the strong need of further validation and consolidation studies for the clinical interpretation of panel-based TMB values.},

	abstract = {Background
High tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an emerging biomarker of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors and has been shown to be more significantly associated with response to PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy than PD-1 or PD-L1 expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The distribution of TMB and the subset of patients with high TMB has not been well characterized in the majority of cancer types.

Methods
In this study, we compare TMB measured by a targeted comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) assay to TMB measured by exome sequencing and simulate the expected variance in TMB when sequencing less than the whole exome. We then describe the distribution of TMB across a diverse cohort of 100,000 cancer cases and test for association between somatic alterations and TMB in over 100 tumor types.

Results
We demonstrate that measurements of TMB from comprehensive genomic profiling are strongly reflective of measurements from whole exome sequencing and model that below 0.5 Mb the variance in measurement increases significantly. We find that a subset of patients exhibits high TMB across almost all types of cancer, including many rare tumor types, and characterize the relationship between high TMB and microsatellite instability status. We find that TMB increases significantly with age, showing a 2.4-fold difference between age 10 and age 90 years. Finally, we investigate the molecular basis of TMB and identify genes and mutations associated with TMB level. We identify a cluster of somatic mutations in the promoter of the gene PMS2, which occur in 10\% of skin cancers and are highly associated with increased TMB.

Conclusions
These results show that a CGP assay targeting {\textasciitilde}1.1 Mb of coding genome can accurately assess TMB compared with sequencing the whole exome. Using this method, we find that many disease types have a substantial portion of patients with high TMB who might benefit from immunotherapy. Finally, we identify novel, recurrent promoter mutations in PMS2, which may be another example of regulatory mutations contributing to tumorigenesis.

	abstract = {Clinical evidence demonstrates that treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy agents can have considerable benefit across multiple tumours. However, there is a need for the development of predictive biomarkers that identify patients who are most likely to respond to immunotherapy. Comprehensive characterisation of tumours using genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches continues to lead the way in advancing precision medicine. Genetic correlates of response to therapy have been known for some time, but recent clinical evidence has strengthened the significance of high tumour mutational burden (TMB) as a biomarker of response and hence a rational target for immunotherapy. Concordantly, immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed clinical practice for lung cancer and melanoma, which are tumour types with some of the highest mutational burdens. TMB is an implementable approach for molecular biology and/or pathology laboratories that provides a quantitative measure of the total number of mutations in tumour tissue of patients and can be assessed by whole genome, whole exome, or large targeted gene panel sequencing of biopsied material. Currently, TMB assessment is not standardised across research and clinical studies. As a biomarker that affects treatment decisions, it is essential to unify TMB assessment approaches to allow for reliable, comparable results across studies. When implementing TMB measurement assays, it is important to consider factors that may impact the method workflow, the results of the assay, and the interpretation of the data. Such factors include biopsy sample type, sample quality and quantity, genome coverage, sequencing platform, bioinformatic pipeline, and the definitions of the final threshold that determines high TMB. This review outlines the factors for adoption of TMB measurement into clinical practice, providing an understanding of TMB assay considerations throughout the sample journey, and suggests principles to effectively implement TMB assays in a clinical setting to aid and optimise treatment decisions.},

Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the gold standard to derive the TMB; while targeted next-generation sequencing panels might be more feasible. However, mainstream panels use 'correlation' (R2) between panel- and WES-based TMB to validate TMB estimation, which could be vulnerable to be distorted by cases with relatively ultra-high TMB within each cancer type. The FDA-approved FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) panel-based TMB estimation seemed reliable (R2 ≥ 0.75) in 24 out of 33 cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas, but most of them were overestimated by correlation as only seven cancer types had satisfactory accuracy (the proportion of cases correctly identified as TMB-high or TMB-low using panel-based TMB) above 90\%. After removing cases with relatively ultra-high TMB within each cancer type, the correlation (R2) in 16 of these 24 cancer types declined dramatically (Δ {\textgreater} 0.25) while all of their accuracy remained generally constant, indicating that accuracy is more robust than correlation. Similar results were also observed in other four panels. Further incorporating accuracy in panel design revealed that the minimal number of genes needed to achieve ≥ 90\% accuracy varied among cancer types and correlated negatively with their TMB levels (p = 0.001). In summary, currently available panels can accurately assess TMB only in several particular cancer types; and accuracy outperformed correlation in assessing the performance of panel-based TMB estimation. Accuracy and cancer type individualization should be incorporated in designing panels for TMB estimation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The focus of tumour-specific antigen analyses has been on single nucleotide variants (SNVs), with the contribution of small insertions and deletions (indels) less well characterised. We investigated whether the frameshift nature of indel mutations, which create novel open reading frames and a large quantity of mutagenic peptides highly distinct from self, might contribute to the immunogenic phenotype.
METHODS: We analysed whole-exome sequencing data from 5777 solid tumours, spanning 19 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We compared the proportion and number of indels across the cohort, with a subset of results replicated in two independent datasets. We assessed in-silico tumour-specific neoantigen predictions by mutation type with pan-cancer analysis, together with RNAseq profiling in renal clear cell carcinoma cases (n=392), to compare immune gene expression across patient subgroups. Associations between indel burden and treatment response were assessed across four checkpoint inhibitor datasets.
FINDINGS: We observed renal cell carcinomas to have the highest proportion (0·12) and number of indel mutations across the pan-cancer cohort (p{\textless}2·2 × 10-16), more than double the median proportion of indel mutations in all other cancer types examined. Analysis of tumour-specific neoantigens showed that enrichment of indel mutations for high-affinity binders was three times that of non-synonymous SNV mutations. Furthermore, neoantigens derived from indel mutations were nine times enriched for mutant specific binding, as compared with non-synonymous SNV derived neoantigens. Immune gene expression analysis in the renal clear cell carcinoma cohort showed that the presence of mutant-specific neoantigens was associated with upregulation of antigen presentation genes, which correlated (r=0·78) with T-cell activation as measured by CD8-positive expression. Finally, analysis of checkpoint inhibitor response data revealed frameshift indel count to be significantly associated with checkpoint inhibitor response across three separate melanoma cohorts (p=4·7 × 10-4).
INTERPRETATION: Renal cell carcinomas have the highest pan-cancer proportion and number of indel mutations. Evidence suggests indels are a highly immunogenic mutational class, which can trigger an increased abundance of neoantigens and greater mutant-binding specificity.

Assuming that common biochemical pathways might be involved in the deaths of 2B4.11 and LyD9, we isolated the PD-1 gene, a novel member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, by using subtractive hybridization technique. The predicted PD-1 protein has a variant form of the consensus sequence found in cytoplasmic tails of signal transducing polypeptides associated with immune recognition receptors. The PD-1 gene was activated in both stimulated 2B4.11 and IL-3-deprived LyD9 cells, but not in other death-induced cell lines that did not show the characteristic features of the classical programmed cell death. Expression of the PD-1 mRNA in mouse was restricted to the thymus and increased when thymocyte death was augmented by in vivo injection of anti-CD3 antibody.

Using WES data of 315 RCC patients, we identified the exons in which the number of mutational sites of the coding DNA sequences associated with TMB through linear regression analysis. Then, among these exons, we extracted a signature composed by 102 exons ({\textasciitilde}0.13 Mbp) through a heuristic selection procedure. The TMB estimated by the signature was highly correlated with those calculated by WES in the discovery dataset (R2=0.9869) and three independent validation datasets (R2=0.9351, R2=0.8063 and R2=0.9527, respectively). And the performance of the signature was superior to a colorectal-specific TMB estimation model contained 22 genes ({\textasciitilde}0.24 Mbp). Moreover, between TMB-high and TMB-low RCC patients, there were significantly differences in the frequencies of microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylator phenotype, BRAF, KRAS and POLE/POLD1 mutation status (p{\textless}0.01).

In summary, we developed an exon signature that can accurately estimate TMB in RCC patients, and the cost and time required for the assessment of TMB can be considerably decreased, making it more suitable for blood and/or biopsy samples.},

	abstract = {As more clinically relevant cancer genes are identified, comprehensive diagnostic approaches are needed to match patients to therapies, raising the challenge of optimization and analytical validation of assays that interrogate millions of bases of cancer genomes altered by multiple mechanisms. Here we describe a test based on massively parallel DNA sequencing to characterize base substitutions, short insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations and selected fusions across 287 cancer-related genes from routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical specimens. We implemented a practical validation strategy with reference samples of pooled cell lines that model key determinants of accuracy, including mutant allele frequency, indel length and amplitude of copy change. Test sensitivity achieved was 95-99\% across alteration types, with high specificity (positive predictive value {\textgreater}99\%). We confirmed accuracy using 249 FFPE cancer specimens characterized by established assays. Application of the test to 2,221 clinical cases revealed clinically actionable alterations in 76\% of tumors, three times the number of actionable alterations detected by current diagnostic tests.},

	abstract = {The relation between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and outcome of cancer patients receiving immunotherapy has been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of TMB in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Databases including Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched to identify potentially eligible studies until Sep 2018 without language limitation. Studies assessing high versus low TMB in predicting survival of various cancer patients were selected. The pooled analyses were conducted using hazard ratio (HR) of high versus low TMB for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the odds ratio (OR) for overall response rate (ORR). The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary outcomes were PFS and ORR. A total of 45 studies consisting of 103078 cancer patients were included. The combined results showed that high TMB was associated with better OS (HR = 0.40; 95\% confidence interval (CI):0.30-0.53; p{\textless} .00001), PFS (HR = 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.26-0.53; p{\textless} .00001) and ORR (OR = 4.62; 95\%CI: 2.90-7.34; p{\textless} .0001) when treated with immunotherapy. In studying patients with high TMB, these patients had improved OS (HR = 0.69; 95\%CI: 0.47-1.03; p= .07) when comparing immunotherapy to chemotherapy. Subgroup analyses suggested that the prognostic role of TMB was independent of cancer types and TMB detection methods (all p{\textless} .05). Our findings suggest that high TMB is associated with better survival in cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. For cancer patients with high TMB, immunotherapy could be considered.},

New significantly mutated genes included PPP3CA, DOT1L, and FTSJD1 in lung ADC, RASA1 in lung SqCC, and KLF5, EP300, and CREBBP in both tumor types. New amplification peaks encompassed MIR21 in lung ADC, MIR205 in lung SqCC, and MAPK1 in both. Lung ADCs lacking receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras-Raf pathway alterations had mutations in SOS1, VAV1, RASA1, and ARHGAP35. Regarding neoantigens, 47\% of the lung ADC and 53\% of the lung SqCC tumors had at least five predicted neoepitopes. Although targeted therapies for lung ADC and SqCC are largely distinct, immunotherapies may aid in treatment for both subtypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Panel sequencing based estimates of tumor mutational burden (psTMB) are increasingly replacing whole exome sequencing (WES) tumor mutational burden as predictive biomarker of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).
DESIGN: A mathematical law describing psTMB variability was derived using a random mutation model and complemented by the contributions of non-randomly mutated real-world cancer genomes and intratumoral heterogeneity through simulations in publicly available datasets.
RESULTS: The coefficient of variation (CV) of psTMB decreased inversely proportional with the square root of the panel size and the square root of the TMB level. In silico simulations of all major commercially available panels in the TCGA pan-cancer cohort confirmed the validity of this mathematical law and demonstrated that the CV was 35\% for TMB = 10 muts/Mbp for the largest panels of size 1.1-1.4 Mbp. Accordingly, misclassification rates (gold standard: WES) to separate 'TMBhigh' from 'TMBlow' using a cut-point of 199 mutations were 10\%-12\% in TCGA-LUAD and 17\%-19\% in TCGA-LUSC. A novel three-tier psTMB classification scheme which accounts for the likelihood of misclassification is proposed. Simulations in two WES datasets of immunotherapy treated patients revealed that small gene panels were poor predictors of ICB response. Moreover, we noted substantial intratumoral variance of psTMB scores in the TRACERx 100 cohort and identified indel burden as independent marker complementing missense mutation burden.
CONCLUSIONS: A universal mathematical law describes accuracy limitations inherent to psTMB, which result in substantial misclassification rates. This scenario can be controlled by two measures: (i) a panel design that is based on the mathematical law described in this article: halving the CV requires a fourfold increase in panel size, (ii) a novel three-tier TMB classification scheme. Moreover, inclusion of indel burden can complement TMB reports. This work has substantial implications for panel design, TMB testing, clinical trials and patient management.},

	abstract = {Gene or protein expression data are usually represented by metric or at least ordinal variables. In order to translate a continuous variable into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point and to stratify patients into two groups each requiring a different kind of treatment. Currently, there is no standard method or standard software for biomarker cutoff determination. Therefore, we developed Cutoff Finder, a bundle of optimization and visualization methods for cutoff determination that is accessible online. While one of the methods for cutoff optimization is based solely on the distribution of the marker under investigation, other methods optimize the correlation of the dichotomization with respect to an outcome or survival variable. We illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the analysis of the gene expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues. This distribution of these important markers is analyzed and correlated with immunohistologically determined ER status and distant metastasis free survival. Cutoff Finder is expected to fill a relevant gap in the available biometric software repertoire and will enable faster optimization of new diagnostic biomarkers.

Different genetic instability processes result in distinct non-random patterns of DNA mutations, also known as mutational signatures. We developed \textit{mutSignatures}, an integrated R-based computational framework aimed at deciphering DNA mutational signatures. Our software provides advanced functions for importing DNA variants, computing mutation types, and extracting mutational signatures via non-negative matrix factorization. We applied \textit{mutSignatures} to analyze somatic mutations found in smoking-related cancer datasets. We characterized mutational signatures that were consistent with those reported before in independent investigations. Our work demonstrates that selected mutational signatures correlated with specific clinical and molecular features across different cancer types, and revealed complementarity of specific mutational patterns that has not previously been identified. In conclusion, we propose \textit{mutSignatures} as a powerful open-source tool for detecting the molecular determinants of cancer and gathering insights into cancer biology and treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It has recently become apparent that CTLA-4, a second counterreceptor for the B7 family of costimulatory molecules, is a negative regulator of T cell activation. Here, in vivo administration of antibodies to CTLA-4 resulted in the rejection of tumors, including preestablished tumors. Furthermore, this rejection resulted in immunity to a secondary exposure to tumor cells. These results suggest that blockade of the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 can allow for, and potentiate, effective immune responses against tumor cells.},

	abstract = {In 2011, Bristol-Myers Squibb set the price of its newly approved melanoma drug ipilimumab—
brand name Yervoy—at \$120,000 for a course of therapy. The drug was associated with an
incremental increase in life expectancy of four months. Drugs like ipilimumab have fueled the
perception that the launch prices of new anticancer drugs and other drugs in the so-called
"specialty" pharmaceutical market have been increasing over time and that increases are unrelated
to the magnitude of the expected health benefits. In this paper, we discuss the unique features of
the market for anticancer drugs and assess trends in the launch prices for 58 anticancer drugs
approved between 1995 and 2013 in the United States. We restrict attention to anticancer drugs
because the use of median survival time as a primary outcome measure provides a common,
objective scale for quantifying the incremental benefit of new products. We find that the average
launch price of anticancer drugs, adjusted for inflation and health benefits, increased by 10
percent annually—or an average of \$8,500 per year—from 1995 to 2013. We argue that the
institutional features of the market for anticancer drugs enable manufacturers to set the prices of
new products at or slightly above the prices of existing therapies, giving rise to an upward trend in
launch prices. Government-mandated price discounts for certain classes of buyers may have also
contributed to launch price increases as firms sought to offset the growth in the discount segment
by setting higher prices for the remainder of the market.},

Understanding genomic correlates of response and resistance to checkpoint blockade may enhance benefits for patients with cancer by elucidating biomarkers for patient stratification and resistance mechanisms for therapeutic targeting. Here we review emerging genomic markers of checkpoint blockade response, including those related to neoantigens, antigen presentation, DNA repair, and oncogenic pathways. Compelling evidence also points to a role for T cell functionality, checkpoint regulators, chromatin modifiers, and copy-number alterations in mediating selective response to immune checkpoint blockade. Ultimately, efforts to contextualize genomic correlates of response into the larger understanding of tumor immune biology will build a foundation for the development of novel biomarkers and therapies to overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.5161},
	abstract = {Importance: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is increasingly used in the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) can interfere with cfDNA testing and cause incorrect interpretation of results. There is an urgent need to better understand this problem following recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of poly(ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for metastatic prostate cancer based on variants in DNA repair genes that can be affected by CHIP.
Objective: To determine the prevalence of clinically relevant CHIP interference in prostate cancer cfDNA testing.
Design, Setting, and Participants: We report a case series of 69 patients with advanced prostate cancer (metastatic disease or with rising PSA following localized therapy) who had cfDNA variant testing with a large panel cancer next generation sequencing assay (UW-OncoPlexCT). To determine the source of variants in plasma, we tested paired cfDNA and whole blood control samples. The study was carried out in an academic medical center system reference laboratory.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and gene spectrum of CHIP interference in patients with prostate cancer undergoing cfDNA testing.
Results: We detected CHIP variants at 2\% or more variant fraction in cfDNA from 13 of 69 men with prostate cancer (19\%; 95\% CI, 10\%-30\%). Seven men (10\%; 95\% CI, 4\%-20\%) had CHIP variants in DNA repair genes used to determine PARPi candidacy, including ATM (n = 5), BRCA2 (n = 1), and CHEK2 (n = 1). Overall, CHIP variants accounted for almost half of the somatic DNA repair gene variants detected. Participant CHIP variants were exponentially correlated with older age (R2 = 0.82). CHIP interference variants could be distinguished from prostate cancer variants using a paired whole-blood control.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, approximately 10\% of men with advanced prostate cancer had CHIP interference in plasma cfDNA in DNA repair genes that are used for eligibility of PARPi therapy, most frequently in ATM. Clinical cfDNA testing should include a paired whole-blood control to exclude CHIP variants and avoid misdiagnosis.},

Cancer cells do not exist in isolation: rather, they exist within a complex microenvironment composed of stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Within this tumour microenvironment exists an interplay between the two main stromal cell subtypes, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells, that are important in controlling metastasis. A complex network of paracrine signalling pathways between CAFs, immune cells and tumour cells are involved at multiple stages of the metastatic process, from invasion and intravasation at the primary tumour site to extravasation and colonisation in the metastatic site. Heterogeneity and plasticity within stromal cell populations also contribute to the complexity. Although many of these processes are likely to be common to a number of metastatic sites, we will describe in detail the interplay within the liver, a preferred site of metastasis for many tumours. A greater understanding of these networks provides opportunities for the design of new therapeutic approaches for targeting the metastatic disease.},

The TST panel was clinically validated in 81 tumors (99\% hotspot mutation concordance), after which 533 consecutive NSCLCs were collected during one-year of routine clinical analysis in the healthcare region (˜90\% advanced stage patients).

	abstract = {Introduction
The identification of tumour mutational burden (TMB) as a biomarker of response to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy has necessitated the development of genomic assays to measure this. We carried out comprehensive molecular profiling of cancers using the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500) panel and compared these to whole-genome sequencing (WGS).

Methods
Cancer samples derived from formalin-fixed material were profiled on the TSO500 panel, sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument and processed through the TSO500 Docker pipeline. Either FASTQ files (PierianDx) or vcf files (OncoKDM) were processed to understand clinical actionability.

Results
In total, 108 samples (a mixture of colorectal, lung, oesophageal and control samples) were processed via the DNA panel. There was good correlation between TMB, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels and copy-number variations as predicted by TSO500 and WGS (R2 {\textgreater} 0.9) and good reproducibility, with less than 5\% variability between repeated controls. For the RNA panel, 13 samples were processed, with all known fusions observed via orthogonal techniques. For clinical actionability, 72 tier 1 variants and 297 tier 2 variants were detected, with clinical trials identified for all patients.

Conclusions
The TSO500 assay accurately measures TMB, microsatellite instability, SNVs, indels, copy-number/structural variation and gene fusions when compared to WGS and orthogonal technologies. Coupled with a clinical annotation pipeline, this provides a powerful methodology for identification of clinically actionable variants.

Develop and apply a comprehensive and accurate next-generation sequencing based assay to help clinicians to match oncology patients to therapies.

Materials \& methods:
The performance of the CANCERPLEX® assay was assessed using DNA from well-characterized routine clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and cell lines.

Results:
The maximum sensitivity of the assay is 99.5\% and its accuracy is virtually 100\% for detecting somatic alterations with an allele fraction of as low as 10\%. Clinically actionable variants were identified in 93\% of patients (930 of 1000) who underwent testing.

Conclusion:
The test's capacity to determine all of the critical genetic changes, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability status and viral associations has important ramifications on clinical decision support strategies, including identification of patients who are likely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockage therapies.},

Over the last forty years since first discovered, Reg proteins have been implicated in a gamut of maladies including diabetes, various types of cancer of the digestive tract, and Alzheimer disease. Surprisingly though, a consensus is still absent on the regulation of their expression, and molecular underpinning of their function. Here, we provide a critical appraisal of recent findings in the field of Reg protein biology. Specifically, the structural characteristics are reviewed particularly in connection with established or purported functions of different members of the Reg family. Moreover, Reg expression patterns in different tissues both under normal and pathophysiological conditions are summarized. Putative receptors and cascades reported to relay Reg signaling inciting cellular responses are presented aiming at a better appreciation of the biological activities of the distinct Reg moieties. Challenges are also discussed that have hampered thus far the rapid progress in this field such as the use of non-standard nomenclature for Reg molecules among various research groups, the existence of multiple Reg members with significant degree of homology and possibly compensatory modes of action, and the need for common assays with robust readouts of Reg activity. Coordinated research is warranted going forward, given that several research groups have independently linked Reg proteins to diseased states and raised the possibility that these biomolecules can serve as therapeutic targets and biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Forty years of research have established that the p53 tumor suppressor provides a major barrier to neoplastic transformation and tumor progression by its unique ability to act as an extremely sensitive collector of stress inputs, and to coordinate a complex framework of diverse effector pathways and processes that protect cellular homeostasis and genome stability. Missense mutations in the TP53 gene are extremely widespread in human cancers and give rise to mutant p53 proteins that lose tumor suppressive activities, and some of which exert trans-dominant repression over the wild-type counterpart. Cancer cells acquire selective advantages by retaining mutant forms of the protein, which radically subvert the nature of the p53 pathway by promoting invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. In this review, we consider available evidence suggesting that mutant p53 proteins can favor cancer cell survival and tumor progression by acting as homeostatic factors that sense and protect cancer cells from transformation-related stress stimuli, including DNA lesions, oxidative and proteotoxic stress, metabolic inbalance, interaction with the tumor microenvironment, and the immune system. These activities of mutant p53 may explain cancer cell addiction to this particular oncogene, and their study may disclose tumor vulnerabilities and synthetic lethalities that could be exploited for hitting tumors bearing missense TP53 mutations.},

	abstract = {A well-known drawback of ℓ1ℓ1{\textbackslash}ell\_\{1\}-penalized estimators is the systematic shrinkage of the large coefficients towards zero. A simple remedy is to treat Lasso as a model-selection procedure and to perform a second refitting step on the selected support. In this work, we formalize the notion of refitting and provide oracle bounds for arbitrary refitting procedures of the Lasso solution. One of the most widely used refitting techniques which is based on Least-Squares may bring a problem of interpretability, since the signs of the refitted estimator might be flipped with respect to the original estimator. This problem arises from the fact that the Least-Squares refitting considers only the support of the Lasso solution, avoiding any information about signs or amplitudes. To this end, we define a sign consistent refitting as an arbitrary refitting procedure, preserving the signs of the first step Lasso solution and provide Oracle inequalities for such estimators. Finally, we consider special refitting strategies: Bregman Lasso and Boosted Lasso. Bregman Lasso has a fruitful property to converge to the Sign-Least-Squares refitting (Least-Squares with sign constraints), which provides with greater interpretability. We additionally study the Bregman Lasso refitting in the case of orthogonal design, providing with simple intuition behind the proposed method. Boosted Lasso, in contrast, considers information about magnitudes of the first Lasso step and allows to develop better oracle rates for prediction. Finally, we conduct an extensive numerical study to show advantages of one approach over others in different synthetic and semi-real scenarios.},

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},

	abstract = {We study tools for inference conditioned on model selection events that are defined by the generalized lasso regularization path. The generalized lasso estimate is given by the solution of a penalized least squares regression problem, where the penalty is the ℓ1ℓ1{\textbackslash}ell\_\{1\} norm of a matrix DDD times the coefficient vector. The generalized lasso path collects these estimates as the penalty parameter λλ{\textbackslash}lambda varies (from ∞∞{\textbackslash}infty down to 0). Leveraging a (sequential) characterization of this path from Tibshirani and Taylor [37], and recent advances in post-selection inference from Lee at al. [22], Tibshirani et al. [38], we develop exact hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for linear contrasts of the underlying mean vector, conditioned on any model selection event along the generalized lasso path (assuming Gaussian errors in the observations). Our construction of inference tools holds for any penalty matrix DDD. By inspecting specific choices of DDD, we obtain post-selection tests and confidence intervals for specific cases of generalized lasso estimates, such as the fused lasso, trend filtering, and the graph fused lasso. In the fused lasso case, the underlying coordinates of the mean are assigned a linear ordering, and our framework allows us to test selectively chosen breakpoints or changepoints in these mean coordinates. This is an interesting and well-studied problem with broad applications; our framework applied to the trend filtering and graph fused lasso cases serves several applications as well. Aside from the development of selective inference tools, we describe several practical aspects of our methods such as (valid, i.e., fully-accounted-for) post-processing of generalized lasso estimates before performing inference in order to improve power, and problem-specific visualization aids that may be given to the data analyst for he/she to choose linear contrasts to be tested. Many examples, from both simulated and real data sources, are presented to examine the empirical properties of our inference methods.},

The traditional idea of best subset selection methods, which can be regarded as a specific form of penalized likelihood, is computationally too expensive for many modern statistical applications. Other forms of penalized likelihood methods have been successfully developed over the last decade to cope with high dimensionality. They have been widely applied for simultaneously selecting important variables and estimating their effects in high dimensional statistical inference. In this article, we present a brief account of the recent developments of theory, methods, and implementations for high dimensional variable selection. What limits of the dimensionality such methods can handle, what the role of penalty functions is, and what the statistical properties are rapidly drive the advances of the field. The properties of non-concave penalized likelihood and its roles in high dimensional statistical modeling are emphasized. We also review some recent advances in ultra-high dimensional variable selection, with emphasis on independence screening and two-scale methods.},

TTN was identified as the most frequently mutated gene within the pan-cancer cohort, and its mutation number best correlated with TMB assessed by WES (rho = 0.917, p {\textless} 2.2e-16). Colorectal cancer was one of good candidates for the application of this diagnostic model of TTN-TMB, and the correlation coefficients were 0.936 and 0.92 for TMB by WES and TMB by tNGS, respectively. Higher than expected TTN mutation frequencies observed in other FLAGS (FrequentLy mutAted GeneS) are associated with late replication time. Diagnostic accuracy for high TMB group did not differ between TTN-TMB and TMB assessed by tNGS. Classification modeling by machine learning using TTN-TMB for MSI-H diagnosis was constructed, and the diagnostic accuracy was 0.873 by area under the curve in external validation. TTN mutation was enriched in samples possessing high immunostimulatory signatures. We suggest that the mutation load within TTN represents high TMB status.},

However, variability in current methods for TMB estimation and reporting is evident, demonstrating a need for standardization and harmonization of TMB assessment methodology across assays and centers. Two uniquely placed organizations, Friends of Cancer Research (Friends) and the Quality Assurance Initiative Pathology (QuIP), have collaborated to coordinate efforts for international multistakeholder initiatives to address this need. Friends and QuIP, who have partnered with several academic centers, pharmaceutical organizations, and diagnostic companies, have adopted complementary, multidisciplinary approaches toward the goal of proposing evidence-based recommendations for achieving consistent TMB estimation and reporting in clinical samples across assays and centers. Many factors influence TMB assessment, including preanalytical factors, choice of assay, and methods of reporting. Preliminary analyses highlight the importance of targeted gene panel size and composition, and bioinformatic parameters for reliable TMB estimation. Herein, Friends and QuIP propose recommendations toward consistent TMB estimation and reporting methods in clinical samples across assays and centers. These recommendations should be followed to minimize variability in TMB estimation and reporting, which will ensure reliable and reproducible identification of patients who are likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.},

We consider here methods for constructing a cost-effectively concise gene panel to predict TMB. We then investigate the extent to which it is feasible to produce a single gene panel capable of predicting TMB across a range of cancer types, and methods by which one may attempt to do so. We also look into IO resistance mechanisms and genes associated with poor response to ICB, so that we can ensure the best treatment monitoring possible. Finally, we exhibit an IO monitoring panel for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, and analyse its performance in comparison to other commercially available assays.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has impressively benefitted from immunotherapy, in particular from the inhibition of immune checkpoints such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1). However, despite the significant survival benefit for some patients with advanced NSCLC, the objective response rates (ORRs) remain relatively low no more than 20–30\% with a large proportion of patients demonstrating primary resistance. Although the selection of NSCLC patients for the first-line treatment is currently guided by the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry, this is not the case for the second-line setting. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of PD-L1 expression is modest which has prompted the search for additional predictive biomarkers. In this context, the assessment of the tumor mutational burden (TMB), defined as the total number of nonsynonymous mutations in the coding regions of genes, has recently emerged as an additional powerful biomarker to select patients for immunotherapy. The purpose of our review is to highlight the recent advances as well as the challenges and perspectives in the field of TMB and immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC.},

Recently, researchers and clinicians have leveraged next generation sequencing technologies to identify neoantigens and to create personalized immunotherapies for cancer treatment. To create a personalized cancer vaccine, neoantigens must be computationally predicted from matched tumor–normal sequencing data, and then ranked according to their predicted capability in stimulating a T cell response. This candidate neoantigen prediction process involves multiple steps, including somatic mutation identification, HLA typing, peptide processing, and peptide-MHC binding prediction. The general workflow has been utilized for many preclinical and clinical trials, but there is no current consensus approach and few established best practices. In this article, we review recent discoveries, summarize the available computational tools, and provide analysis considerations for each step, including neoantigen prediction, prioritization, delivery, and validation methods. In addition to reviewing the current state of neoantigen analysis, we provide practical guidance, specific recommendations, and extensive discussion of critical concepts and points of confusion in the practice of neoantigen characterization for clinical use. Finally, we outline necessary areas of development, including the need to improve HLA class II typing accuracy, to expand software support for diverse neoantigen sources, and to incorporate clinical response data to improve neoantigen prediction algorithms. The ultimate goal of neoantigen characterization workflows is to create personalized vaccines that improve patient outcomes in diverse cancer types.},

In part 1 of this review we briefly discuss the host immune response to tumors and different approaches to TIL assessment. We propose a standardized methodology to assess TILs in solid tumors on hematoxylin and eosin sections, in both primary and metastatic settings, based on the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group guidelines for TIL assessment in invasive breast carcinoma. A review of the literature regarding the value of TIL assessment in different solid tumor types follows in part 2. The method we propose is reproducible, affordable, easily applied, and has demonstrated prognostic and predictive significance in invasive breast carcinoma. This standardized methodology may be used as a reference against which other methods are compared, and should be evaluated for clinical validity and utility. Standardization of TIL assessment will help to improve consistency and reproducibility in this field, enrich both the quality and quantity of comparable evidence, and help to thoroughly evaluate the utility of TILs assessment in this era of immunotherapy.},

Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers. Ipilimumab, an inhibitor of CTLA-4, is approved for the treatment of advanced or unresectable melanoma. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, both PD-1 inhibitors, are approved to treat patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma and patients with metastatic, refractory non-small cell lung cancer. In addition the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has been approved in patients with BRAF WT metastatic or unresectable melanoma. The roles of CTLA-4 and PD-1 in inhibiting immune responses, including antitumor responses, are largely distinct. CTLA-4 is thought to regulate T-cell proliferation early in an immune response, primarily in lymph nodes, whereas PD-1 suppresses T cells later in an immune response, primarily in peripheral tissues. The clinical profiles of immuno-oncology agents inhibiting these 2 checkpoints may vary based on their mechanistic differences.

	abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or “mutation signatures” at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites. We illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5′ to the mutated site. The overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with “mixed-membership models” which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods. Our methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature\_shiny/.},

Our framework is flexible and may be used to construct an omnibus test or directed against testing specific non-linearities and interaction effects, or for testing the significance of groups of variables. The methodology is based on extracting left-over signal in the residuals from an initial fit of a generalized linear model. This can be achieved by predicting this signal from the residuals using modern flexible regression or machine learning methods such as random forests or boosted trees. Under the null hypothesis that the generalized linear model is correct, no signal is left in the residuals and our test statistic has a Gaussian limiting distribution, translating to asymptotic control of type I error. Under a local alternative, we establish a guarantee on the power of the test.

Recently, clinical trials showed that TMB can also be estimated from targeted sequencing of a panel of only a few hundred genes of interest, which can be performed at a high depth for clinical applications. , Materials and methods: In this study, we systematically investigated the distribution of TMB and preferences at the gene and mutation level, as well as the correlation between TMB calculated by WES and panel sequencing data using somatic mutation data from 15 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). , Results: We proposed a pan-cancer TMB panel and demonstrated that it had a higher correlation with WES than other panels. Our panel could serve as a reference data-set for TMB-oriented panel design to identify patients for immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy by using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has dramatically improved the treatment options in various cancers, increasing survival rates for treated patients. Nevertheless, there are heterogeneous response rates to ICI among different cancer types, and even in the context of patients affected by a specific cancer. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify factors that predict the response to immunotherapeutic approaches. A comprehensive investigation of the mutational and immunological aspects of the tumor can be useful to obtain a robust prediction. By performing a pan-cancer analysis on gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, 8055 cases and 29 cancer types), we set up and validated a machine learning approach to predict the potential for positive response to ICI. Support vector machines (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) models were developed with a 10×5-fold cross-validation schema on 80\% of TCGA cases to predict ICI responsiveness defined by a score combining tumor mutational burden and TGF-β signaling. On the remaining 20\% validation subset, our SVM model scored 0.88 accuracy and 0.27 Matthews Correlation Coefficient. The proposed machine learning approach could be useful to predict the putative response to ICI treatment by expression data of primary tumors.},
