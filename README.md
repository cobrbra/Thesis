# Thesis
This is a repository for my thesis. It is (obviously) a work in progress, and I mostly use it to reflect my plans and how I see my PhD developing, as well as an opportunity to do some background writing when I can't bothered with real work.

Individual chapters are in their own .tex files in the folder chapters, while figures are in the folder figures, again separated by chapter. The main compiled file Thesis.pdf does not recompile automatically at any point (if anyone knows a neat trick to do this I'd be very grateful). References may be a bit ugly as they're auto-imported from zotero.
